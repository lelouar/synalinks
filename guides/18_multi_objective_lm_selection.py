# Picking the Best Language Model: Multi-Objective Search

[Guide 17](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Hyperparameter%20Search/) introduced hyperparameter search and tuned three knobs of
a single language model: chain-of-thought on or off, sampling
temperature, and reasoning effort. In this guide we change the
kind of question we ask. Instead of tuning *one* model, we
**compare several models** on the same task, and we score each
one on **two metrics** at once, not just a single reward.

This is a very practical question. Modern LM providers ship whole
families of models: a small "lite" version, a medium "flash"
version, a large "pro" version. Before you deploy, you usually
have to pick one. The cheap model is fast and inexpensive but may
miss edge cases; the expensive model is accurate but slow and
pricey. What you actually want is the **trade-off curve**, not
just the single winner. The winner depends on how you weight cost
against accuracy, and that weighting is a decision you should make
with the data in front of you.

Two ideas show up in this guide for the first time:

- **Multi-objective optimization.** Instead of a single
  `Objective("val_reward", "max")`, we hand the tuner a *list* of
  objectives. Keras-Tuner aggregates them into a single scalar per
  trial and ranks trials by that aggregate, while keeping each
  individual metric recorded so you can inspect the trade-off
  after the fact.
- **Grid search.** When the search space is small and discrete,
  for example, "try each of these three models exactly once",
  `GridSearch` enumerates the combinations deterministically.
  `RandomSearch` would sample *with replacement* and could visit
  the same model twice while skipping another; `GridSearch` is
  guaranteed not to.

## The Task: Six-Way Emotion Classification

The dataset we use is
[`dair-ai/emotion`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion):
short tweets each labeled with one of six emotions: `sadness`,
`joy`, `love`, `anger`, `fear`, or `surprise`. What makes this
dataset interesting is that the label distribution is
**imbalanced**: `joy` and `sadness` together cover most of the
corpus, while `love` and `surprise` are rare.

That imbalance is the entire point. A lazy model that always
predicts the majority class can post a respectable accuracy and
still be useless: it gets the easy half right by accident, and
flunks the rare half completely. To surface that failure mode we
need a metric that scores **per class**, not in aggregate.

## Why Two Metrics, and Which Two

We compile each candidate with two metrics:

- **`ExactMatch`**: strict accuracy. The reward is `1.0` if and
  only if *every* class field on the predicted output matches the
  truth, else `0.0`. It captures "did we get the label exactly
  right?" but it does not distinguish between a model that gets
  every class right occasionally and one that gets only the
  majority class right but does so reliably.
- **`BinaryF1Score(average="macro")`**: averaged per-class F1.
  **F1** is the harmonic mean of precision and recall; intuitively,
  it punishes a classifier that wins on one of those at the
  expense of the other. **Macro averaging** computes the F1 of
  each class separately and then averages, so a class with only a
  handful of examples (like `love` or `surprise`) contributes the
  same weight as a frequent one (like `joy`). A model that
  collapses onto the majority class will score high on accuracy
  and low on macro-F1, exactly the trade-off we are trying to
  see.

A footnote you will want before reading the source:
`synalinks.metrics.F1Score` (without `Binary`) is **token-level**
and oriented at open-text QA tasks. For a single categorical label
it collapses to accuracy and tells you nothing new. Whenever your
output has one boolean per class, the layout we are about to
introduce, the right metric is `BinaryF1Score`.

## The Output Schema Is Doing Real Work

Because `BinaryF1Score` operates per class, the output `DataModel`
needs **one boolean field per class**. The LM emits a 0/1 for
each:

```python
class Emotion(synalinks.DataModel):
    sadness:  bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is sadness")
    joy:      bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is joy")
    love:     bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is love")
    anger:    bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is anger")
    fear:     bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is fear")
    surprise: bool = synalinks.Field(description="True if the dominant emotion is surprise")
```

It is tempting to call this layout "one-hot", and the **ground
truth** is one-hot in this dataset, because `dair-ai/emotion`
assigns exactly one class label per tweet. But the schema itself
does **not** enforce that. Six independent booleans can take any
of 2⁶ = 64 combinations; the LM is free to mark two as `True` if
two emotions seem present, or none at all if it cannot decide.
That is a *feature*, not a bug: the same layout doubles as
**multi-label classification**; many real-world tasks (genre
tagging, content moderation, symptom checklists) genuinely have
more than one positive class at once.

If you actually need to enforce "exactly one label," that is a
different schema: a **single field with a `Literal` of the class
names**, paired with the `Categorical*` F1 family (which compares
label *sets* instead of per-field booleans). Sketch:

```python
from typing import Literal

class EmotionCategorical(synalinks.DataModel):
    label: Literal["sadness", "joy", "love", "anger", "fear", "surprise"] = (
        synalinks.Field(description="The dominant emotion")
    )

# Pair with the Categorical F1 family in compile():
program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(),
    metrics=[synalinks.metrics.CategoricalF1Score(average="macro")],
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
)
```

So there are three reasonable layouts for a classification task,
each pairing with a different metric family:

| Layout | Schema | Metric family | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Booleans** | one `bool` per class | `Binary*` | Multi-label; or multi-class where multiple labels are allowed in principle. |
| **Scores** | one `Score` per class | `Binary*(threshold=…)` | Same as booleans, plus you want the LM to express confidence. |
| **Categorical** | single `Literal` field | `Categorical*` | Strictly one label per example, enforced by the schema. |

The take-away worth internalizing: **in Synalinks, the schema you
declare and the metric you measure have to be designed
together.** This guide uses the boolean layout because it makes
the F1-vs-accuracy trade-off vivid even on a single-label dataset;
the variant section below shows the Score version of the same
story.

## A Variant: Confidence Scores Instead of Booleans

`BinaryF1Score` accepts not just `bool` fields but also **floats in
`[0, 1]`**: it just thresholds them at runtime to decide which
side of `0`/`1` each prediction lands on. That opens up a second
output layout: instead of independent booleans per class, ask the
LM for a **confidence per class**. `synalinks.Score` ([Guide 2](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Data%20Models/)) is the
natural type: a discretized `[0, 1]` enum that the LM is
constrained to emit one of eleven values from (`0.0`, `0.1`, ...,
`1.0`).

```python
class EmotionScore(synalinks.DataModel):
    sadness:  synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is sadness")
    joy:      synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is joy")
    love:     synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is love")
    anger:    synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is anger")
    fear:     synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is fear")
    surprise: synalinks.Score = synalinks.Field(description="Confidence that the dominant emotion is surprise")
```

The ground-truth template now emits the literal floats `1.0` /
`0.0` instead of the JSON booleans `true` / `false`; both are
valid `Score` values, so Pydantic accepts them:

```python
OUTPUT_TEMPLATE_SCORE = (
    "{"
    + ", ".join(
        f'"{name}": {{{{ 1.0 if label == {i} else 0.0 }}}}'
        for i, name in enumerate(EMOTION_LABELS)
    )
    + "}"
)
```

The metric line changes by exactly one keyword argument: add
`threshold=0.5` so `BinaryF1Score` knows where to cut the
confidence values:

```python
program.compile(
    reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(),    # see caveat below
    metrics=[synalinks.metrics.BinaryF1Score(average="macro", threshold=0.5)],
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
)
```

**When to prefer which layout.** A short decision guide:

- **Booleans** when the task really is multi-class with one
  winner. The LM has nothing to express beyond "this one." The
  reward `ExactMatch` is the natural strict accuracy.
- **Scores** when you want the LM to express **uncertainty**
  ("`joy: 0.7, love: 0.3`"), when more than one class can be
  simultaneously true (multi-label), or when you plan to use the
  confidence values downstream (e.g. as a ranking signal). The
  reward `ExactMatch` is too strict here because `0.9 ≠ 1.0`;
  `BinaryF1Score` itself (with a threshold) is the usual reward
  choice in this regime.

A small reward-side caveat worth flagging: if you switch to
Score-typed labels, `ExactMatch` will give you `0.0` whenever the
LM's confidence is anything other than the exact ground-truth
value, even `0.99` against `1.0`. Use `BinaryF1Score` as both the
**reward** and the **metric** in that case (or write your own
threshold-based reward via `RewardFunctionWrapper`, [Guide 13](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Rewards/)).

The runnable example below demonstrates both layouts behind a
`USE_SCORE_LABELS` toggle so you can see the wiring of each.

## Loading a Hugging Face Dataset Through Templates

The `dair-ai/emotion` dataset ships its labels as integers `0`
through `5`. Each row has exactly one label, so the rendered
ground-truth record happens to have exactly one `True` field:
the dataset *itself* is single-label, even though our schema
would tolerate multi-label. Before we can train on it, we have to
convert each row into the boolean record our `Emotion` data model
expects.
`synalinks.HuggingFaceDataset` handles this with two **Jinja2
templates**, one for the input side of each row, one for the
output side, that render each Hugging Face row into a JSON
snippet matching the target `DataModel`.

(**Jinja2** is the standard Python templating language; you can
think of it as "string formatting on steroids." The
double-curly-brace syntax `{{ ... }}` evaluates an expression and
substitutes its value into the surrounding text.)

```python
INPUT_TEMPLATE = '{"text": {{ text | tojson }}}'
OUTPUT_TEMPLATE = (
    "{"
    + ",".join(
        f'"{name}": {{{{ (label == {i}) | tojson }}}}'
        for i, name in enumerate(EMOTION_LABELS)
    )
    + "}"
)
```

The `tojson` filter is the safe way to embed a value into JSON:
it escapes quotes, backslashes, and control characters so they
cannot accidentally break the JSON output. Skipping it is the
templating equivalent of forgetting to parameterize a SQL query
([Guide 7](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Knowledge%20Base/)); the bugs it prevents are unpleasant in exactly the
same way. For this dataset, the template emits `true` for the
matching class and `false` for every other one, which yields a
single-label record because the source dataset is single-label.
The `Emotion` schema would happily accept multiple `True` fields
if the data ever called for it.

## Dataset Helpers: `load_split`, `materialize`, `split_train_test`

Three helpers from `synalinks.datasets` (introduced in [Guide 11](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Datasets/))
do all of the heavy lifting:

- **`synalinks.datasets.load_split(...)`**: a one-call shortcut
  that builds a `HuggingFaceDataset` with `streaming=False`,
  iterates it to exhaustion, and hands you back numpy object
  arrays. The return shape is `(x, y)` when an output template is
  set (as here), or `(x,)` for inputs-only datasets.
- **`Dataset.materialize()`**: the underlying method on the
  `Dataset` base class that `load_split` calls into. Any
  `Dataset` subclass (HuggingFace, a custom CSV loader, your own
  generator) gets this method for free. Use it when you want to
  build the dataset object explicitly, for instance, to inspect
  it before materializing, or to swap streaming on and off.
- **`synalinks.datasets.split_train_test(x, y, validation_split=0.2)`**:
  a deterministic head/tail slicer. It returns
  `((x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val))` after cutting at
  `int(n * (1 - validation_split))`. It is the standard way to
  carve a validation slice out of a single labeled split, useful
  when the source dataset does not ship its own validation split
  (HumanEval, IFEval, BBH, TruthfulQA, BBQ all fit that pattern).

For this guide we *do* have a native `validation` split on
`dair-ai/emotion`, but we use `split_train_test` against the
`train` split anyway, partly because it is the more general
recipe (it works on any single-split source), and partly so you
can see the helper in action:

```python
(x_trainval, y_trainval) = synalinks.datasets.load_split(
    path="dair-ai/emotion",
    split="train",
    input_data_model=Tweet,
    input_template=INPUT_TEMPLATE,
    output_data_model=EmotionLabel,
    output_template=OUTPUT_TEMPLATE,
    limit=NB_TRAINVAL_SAMPLES,
)
(x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val) = synalinks.datasets.split_train_test(
    x_trainval, y_trainval, validation_split=VALIDATION_SPLIT,
)
(x_test, y_test) = synalinks.datasets.load_split(
    path="dair-ai/emotion", split="test", ..., limit=NB_TEST_SAMPLES,
)
```

The shuffle question is worth flagging: `split_train_test` is
deterministic and order-preserving: it slices the head off for
train and the tail off for val. If your source rows are not
already shuffled (HumanEval's prompts, for instance, are sorted
by task ID), shuffle *before* you split. The `datasets` library
lets you pass `shuffle=True` through `load_dataset` kwargs, and
those kwargs forward through `synalinks.datasets.load_split`.

## A Multi-Objective `GridSearch`

The tuner construction is almost the same as in [Guide 17](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Hyperparameter%20Search/), with
two differences:

- **`objective` is a *list*.** When you pass more than one
  objective, Keras-Tuner internally wraps the list in a
  `MultiObjective` object and aggregates the metrics into a
  single scalar (a weighted sum, by default with equal weights)
  for the oracle's ranking. The individual metrics stay recorded
  on each trial, so you can inspect the trade-off later; the
  aggregate is just there to let the oracle compare apples to
  apples.
- We use **`GridSearch`** instead of `RandomSearch`, because we
  want each model evaluated *exactly* once. (More on this below.)

```python
tuner = synalinks.tuners.GridSearch(
    build_program,
    objective=[
        synalinks.tuners.Objective("val_reward", direction="max"),
        synalinks.tuners.Objective("val_binary_f1_score", direction="max"),
    ],
    max_trials=len(CANDIDATE_MODELS),
    directory="examples",
    project_name="emotion_lm_selection",
    overwrite=True,
)
```

Both objectives are *maximized* in this example, but you can mix
directions freely. A common third axis is a `min` objective on
cost or latency: for instance, if you record
`val_tokens_per_request` as a metric, you can ask the tuner to
maximize accuracy *and* minimize tokens at the same time, and the
ranking will reflect both. That is exactly the "I want a model
that is accurate *and* cheap" question we set out to answer.

## Reading the Pareto Trade-off

When the search finishes, the *winning* trial is simply the one
with the highest *aggregated* score. But the genuinely interesting
output of a multi-objective search is the **per-model table** that
lists every model's individual scores side by side. That table is
your view of the **Pareto frontier**, a term worth pinning down.

The **Pareto frontier** is the set of configurations where you
cannot improve one metric without hurting another. A configuration
is on the frontier if no other configuration is strictly better
than it on *both* metrics at once. The frontier is not a single
point but a curve (or, in higher dimensions, a surface) of
"acceptable" trade-offs. Choosing one point on the frontier over
another is a *business* decision: how much accuracy am I willing
to give up for a fraction of the cost? Not a math problem.

```
trial  model                                       reward       f1
0001   gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview        0.500    0.402
0002   gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-preview             0.667    0.531
0003   gemini/gemini-3.1-pro-preview               0.750    0.624
```

(Numbers shown here are illustrative; your run will differ.)

A model that scores high on `reward` but low on `f1` is
overfitting to the majority classes: it gets the easy half right
and quietly fails on the rare half. A model that scores about the
same on both metrics, even at a lower absolute level, is making
**balanced** mistakes, and that is often what you want in
practice, because the rare classes are usually the ones the user
notices.

For a really honest comparison you would run **multiple seeds per
model** and plot the Pareto frontier in two dimensions, so the
trade-off has uncertainty bars on it. The script below does a
single seed per model so that one search fits in a few minutes on
a laptop, but in production work, do not skip the multiple-seed
step.

## Take-Home Summary

- **Multi-objective search** passes a *list* of `Objective`s.
  Keras-Tuner aggregates them per trial and ranks accordingly,
  while keeping the individual metrics recorded so you can
  inspect the trade-off.
- **`BinaryF1Score` with `average="macro"`** is the standard
  metric for *imbalanced* multi-class classification. Plain
  accuracy rewards majority-class collapse; macro-F1 does not.
- The output `DataModel` **must have one boolean field per
  class** for `BinaryF1Score` to read it. The shape of the
  schema is dictated by the metric.
- **`GridSearch`** is the right tuner when the search space is a
  small discrete sweep: for example, "each model in this list,
  exactly once."
- A `HuggingFaceDataset` plus Jinja2 input/output templates is
  how you pipe a public dataset's raw rows into your `DataModel`
  schemas.
- Always **rebuild the winner from `best_hp`** and evaluate on a
  held-out test split; the validation scores were used by the
  oracle and overstate generalization.
- The point of multi-objective search is **the Pareto frontier**,
  not a single winner. The frontier is your engineering tool for
  the cost-vs-accuracy decision.

"""Helpers for the open Agent Skills standard (https://agentskills.io).

A *skill* is a directory with a ``SKILL.md`` (YAML frontmatter + Markdown
instructions) and optional ``scripts/`` / ``references/`` / ``assets/``. The
model follows **progressive disclosure**: only each skill's ``name`` +
``description`` are surfaced up front (the ``<available_skills>`` prompt block);
the full ``SKILL.md`` body and bundled files are read on demand through the
agent's own file / bash tools, so a code agent (Deep Agent / RLM) consumes
skills with no extra machinery.

All spec-governed logic (YAML frontmatter parsing, the naming / length /
allowed-field validation rules, and the ``<available_skills>`` XML) is
delegated to Anthropic's official reference library ``skills-ref``
(https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills); this module only adds the layer
``skills-ref`` does not provide: a `Skill` `Entity` DataModel (the spec
frontmatter as a synalinks data model), multi-root directory discovery
(`discover_skills` / `discover_skills_in_roots`), root path resolution
(`resolve_skills_paths`), and a `skills_prompt` that adds a sandbox ``root``
override on top of ``skills_ref.to_prompt``. Like ``skills-ref``, discovery and
the prompt work in terms of skill *directories*; a skill's Markdown body and
bundled files are not modelled here; they are read on demand. The general
agent helpers (workdir, AGENTS.md, tool merging, input summaries) live in
``agents_utils``.

# Deployment: FastMCP

The previous guide,
[FastAPI Deployment](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/FastAPI%20Deployment/), exposed a Synalinks
program to **HTTP** callers: browsers, mobile apps, other backend
services. This guide exposes the same kind of program to a *very*
different kind of caller: a **language model client**.

If you have used Claude Desktop or Cursor and noticed that they can
call external tools (search the web, edit a file, query a database),
that's the world we are stepping into.

## What Is MCP?

**MCP** stands for *Model Context Protocol*. It is a small, open
protocol (published by Anthropic in 2024) that lets a language
model client discover and call **tools** that you define. From the
LM's point of view, your program looks like a function it can
choose to invoke. From your point of view, the LM and the wire are
somebody else's problem; you only have to write the function.

**[FastMCP][fastmcp]** is the standard Python framework for writing
MCP servers. It plays the same role that FastAPI plays for REST: you
write typed Python functions, the framework handles the protocol.

[fastmcp]: https://gofastmcp.com/

If you've read the FastAPI guide, the next sentence will sound
familiar, and that's the point: most of what you know transfers.

## The Same Trick, Repeated

A Synalinks `Program` is an async function. An MCP **tool** is an
async function. So once again the adapter is small (we'll show
where `program` comes from in the *Lifespan* section just below;
ignore the missing import for now):

```python
@mcp.tool
async def solve(query: str) -> NumericalAnswer:
    \"\"\"Solve a word problem.\"\"\"
    result = await program(Query(query=query))    # `program`: see below
    return NumericalAnswer.model_validate(result.get_json())
```

(As in the sibling FastAPI guide, snippets here are illustrative;
the complete file lives under `## Source` at the bottom.)

FastMCP cares about three things in that function:

- **Its name** (`solve`) becomes the tool name shown to the LM
  client.
- **Its argument and return types** become the tool's JSON schema.
  Scalar types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`) appear as flat,
  top-level tool parameters; that is what LM clients invoke best.
  Synalinks DataModels are Pydantic models, so FastMCP accepts them
  directly *too*; use them when an argument is genuinely
  structured. For the single-string input here we take a `str` and
  wrap it into our internal `Query` model on the next line; that
  way the LM sees a clean `query: string` parameter, not a nested
  object with a `query.query` field.
- **Its docstring** becomes the description the LM sees when it is
  deciding *whether* to call this tool. Write it as a prompt to the
  model, not as a developer-facing API note. ("Use this tool when
  the user asks…" reads well to an LM; "REST endpoint for solving"
  does not.)

A note on **shape, not type**: the program's *input* schema
(`Query`) and the tool's *argument* schema are allowed to differ.
FastAPI happens to make them line up: REST conventionally wraps a
body in a JSON object, and `Query(query="...")` matches that
exactly. MCP is a function-call protocol, so flat keyword
arguments are the natural shape. The tool body bridges the two.

## Two Steps, Not One: Build, Then Serve

The same warning that opened the FastAPI guide applies here: do not
let your MCP server build the program on first start. Building
means talking to an LM provider, which is exactly the kind of work
a server should not be doing during boot. If the build half-fails,
you have a half-initialised server confidently exposing a broken
tool.

So we keep the same two-step shape:

1. **Build the artifact once.** This file exposes a regular
   `build_and_save_program(path)` function and a `build` CLI verb
   that calls it. Run it from a shell, a CI job, or a Python REPL,
   wherever you prepare other ML artifacts:

   ```bash
   # From a shell:
   python -m guides.20_fastmcp_deployment build
   ```

   ```python
   # Or, equivalently, from a notebook / REPL. (The module name starts
   # with a digit, so import it via importlib rather than `import`.)
   import asyncio, importlib
   mod = importlib.import_module("guides.20_fastmcp_deployment")
   asyncio.run(mod.build_and_save_program(mod.PROGRAM_PATH))
   ```

2. **Serve.** The server's only startup job is to *load*
   `math_agent.json`. If the file is missing, it fails loudly, not
   silently.

## Lifespan: Loading The Program Once

Like FastAPI, FastMCP has a **lifespan**: an `async` context
manager that runs once at server startup and once at shutdown.
Whatever you `yield` from the lifespan becomes available on
`Context.lifespan_context` inside every tool call. (Don't worry too
much about the word "context" here; it's just FastMCP's name for
"the bundle of information available during one tool call.")

If you read the FastAPI guide, you've seen this exact pattern. One
small surface difference: the FastAPI lifespan receives `app:
FastAPI`, the FastMCP lifespan receives `server` (the `FastMCP`
instance). Same idea, different framework-supplied argument.

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(server):
    if not PROGRAM_PATH.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(
            f"{PROGRAM_PATH} not found. Run "
            f"`python -m guides.20_fastmcp_deployment build` first."
        )
    program = synalinks.Program.load(str(PROGRAM_PATH))
    yield {"program": program}
```

To reach the yielded dict from inside a tool, take a `Context`
argument; FastMCP will inject it automatically as long as the
*type* is `Context`:

```python
from fastmcp import Context

@mcp.tool
async def solve(query: str, ctx: Context) -> NumericalAnswer:
    \"\"\"Solve a word problem expressed in natural language.\"\"\"
    program = ctx.lifespan_context["program"]
    result = await program(Query(query=query))
    answer_json = result.out_mask(mask=["messages"]).get_json()
    return NumericalAnswer.model_validate(answer_json)
```

The `out_mask` + `get_json()` + `model_validate(...)` step is the
same as in the FastAPI guide. The reason is the same: `await
program(...)` returns a generic `JsonDataModel` (on purpose, so
internal modules can reshape data freely), and an agent in
particular also returns its trajectory (`messages`) for training
and observability. At the boundary of *your* system you want the
typed view back, so we drop the trajectory with `out_mask` and
validate the rest against the response model.

## Transports

`mcp.run()` decides *how* the tool talks to its client. There are
two transports worth using today, plus a third kept for
backwards compatibility:

- **stdio** (default). The tool reads requests from standard input
  and writes responses to standard output, the same way command-
  line programs read and write text. The client launches your
  process as a subprocess. This is how Claude Desktop and Cursor
  use local MCP tools. If in doubt, this is the right choice.
- **http**: a regular HTTP server (streamable). Use this when the
  client is on a different machine. Replace `mcp.run()` at the
  bottom of this file with
  `mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8001)`, or use
  `fastmcp run --transport http ...` from the FastMCP CLI.
- *(legacy)* **sse** (Server-Sent Events): an older HTTP-based
  transport. Still supported, but the MCP spec is moving to
  streamable HTTP. New deployments should prefer `http`.

## Running The Server

Prerequisites: an LM you have access to. The build function
defaults to `gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, which expects
a `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var. If you don't have one, edit
`build_and_save_program` and change the model string; a free
local option is `"ollama/mistral:latest"` (see
[Getting Started](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Getting%20Started/) for setup). `fastmcp`
itself is already a Synalinks dependency, so nothing extra to
install.

This module follows the standard FastMCP conventions from the
[official quickstart][fastmcp-quickstart]: a module-level `mcp`
object, `@mcp.tool` decorators, and `mcp.run()` inside
`if __name__ == "__main__":`. So:

```bash
# stdio (default) -- the way LM clients usually launch you:
python -m guides.20_fastmcp_deployment

# or run with the FastMCP CLI:
fastmcp run guides/20_fastmcp_deployment.py
```

Connecting a local MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) is a
matter of adding a config entry that points at this script with
`stdio` as the transport. The exact format depends on the client;
their docs cover it.

If you're new to FastMCP, read the
[official quickstart][fastmcp-quickstart] alongside this guide. The
*shape* of the module (`FastMCP("name")`, `@mcp.tool`,
`mcp.run()`) is copied verbatim from there; only the *body* of
the tool is Synalinks-specific.

[fastmcp-quickstart]: https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/quickstart

## Error Handling

There are *two* layers of "tool" in this file and the rules differ
slightly between them. Keeping them straight saves a lot of
confusion:

- The **inner tool**, `calculate`, is called by the agent *inside*
  the program. The agent loop is forgiving: if `calculate` returns
  `{"result": None, "log": "Error: ..."}`, the agent reads the log,
  tries a different approach, and keeps going. That's why
  `calculate` returns a dict with a `log` field instead of raising.
- The **MCP tool**, `solve`, is the outer boundary that talks to a
  language-model client. Here, errors are *part of the protocol*:
  if `solve` raises, FastMCP captures the exception, sends a
  structured error back to the client, and the LM on the other
  side gets a chance to react: by retrying with corrected input
  or by telling its user something went wrong.

Two practical consequences for the *outer* MCP tool:

- **Do not swallow exceptions inside a tool.** Let them propagate.
  An LM that sees a clear error can fix its own mistake; an LM
  that sees an empty response can only guess.
- **Crash early on bad input.** A clear `ValueError("expression
  must contain at least one digit")` is more useful to the model
  than a generic 500 deep inside the call.

By default FastMCP forwards the exception message verbatim to the
client. This is the right default for development: the LM (and
you, reading the logs) get useful information. In production you
will eventually want to pass `mask_error_details=True` to
`FastMCP(...)`: the *client* gets a generic message ("internal
error") while the *server* logs the real one. The trade-off is
real, in both directions:

- *Unmasked* leaks debugging detail to anything that talks to your
  server.
- *Masked* starves the LM of the retry signal that would have let
  it fix its own mistake.

Pick by deployment, not by reflex.

## Bonus: Re-using A FastAPI App As An MCP Server

If you already have the FastAPI server from the previous guide,
FastMCP can lift its endpoints into MCP tools for you in one line:

```python
import importlib
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Your FastAPI module from the previous guide (its name starts with a
# digit, so import it via importlib rather than `import`).
fastapi_app = importlib.import_module("guides.19_fastapi_deployment")

mcp = FastMCP.from_fastapi(
    fastapi_app.app,
    name="math-agent",
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Each FastAPI route becomes one MCP tool, with the route's Pydantic
request/response models reused as the tool's schema. This is the
cheapest way to make a single program reachable from both audiences.

One caveat worth knowing about: the auto-lifted tool inherits the
FastAPI route's request *body* shape. In our case the FastAPI
handler takes `query: Query`, so the auto-generated MCP tool ends
up with a nested `query.query` parameter, the exact shape we
hand-flattened to `query: str` above. If you go this route and
want a clean LM-facing schema, either flatten on the FastAPI side
(at the cost of less idiomatic REST), or accept the nested form
and trust the LM to fill it in.

## Concurrency Note

(Safe to skip on a first read; only matters once you train.)

Same caveat as the FastAPI guide: the program is shared across
tool invocations. Serving them only *reads* the program's
trainable variables (the configurable knobs an optimiser tunes
during training; see the [Training](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Training/) guide). The
optimiser is the only thing that ever *writes* to them, and it
doesn't run at tool-call time. If you intend to expose training
itself as a tool, give each training run its own program copy so
they don't fight over the same knobs.

## Take-Home Summary

- **MCP** lets a language model client call your code as a tool.
  **FastMCP** is the Python framework for it.
- An MCP **tool** is an `async def` whose **name**, **signature**,
  and **docstring** become the schema and prompt the LM sees.
  Prefer **scalar argument types** (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`)
  so the LM sees flat top-level parameters; reach for DataModels
  only when an argument is genuinely structured. The tool body
  bridges the wire shape (what the LM sends) and the program shape
  (what your `Program` expects).
- **Build once, serve forever.** The server loads a prepared
  artifact; building inside the server is the wrong place.
- **Load the program in the lifespan; reach it via
  `Context.lifespan_context`.** Same separation as FastAPI: setup
  out of the tool body, work in the tool body.
- **Tool errors are part of the protocol.** Raise honestly; mask
  details in production only when the trade-off is right for that
  deployment.
- **`FastMCP.from_fastapi(app)`** is the one-line trick if you
  already have a FastAPI server and want to expose it to LM
  callers without writing a second adapter.

  guide.
- [Observability](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Observability/): production tracing applies

# Vector RAG Agent

[Guide 7](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Knowledge%20Base/) showed how to store documents in a
`KnowledgeBase` and query them with similarity / fulltext / hybrid
search. [Guide 6](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Agents/) introduced the agent loop. This guide combines
the two: a **Vector RAG Agent** is an agent whose tool set is
pre-wired for retrieval, so the *agent itself* decides whether to
search, what table to search, and how to phrase the query.

## Why Make Retrieval Agentic?

A textbook RAG pipeline is a fixed three-step program:

1. Embed the user's question.
2. Run a single similarity search.
3. Stuff the top-k results into a final prompt.

That works when retrieval is *always* needed, the right phrasing
*is* the user's question, and a single round of results *is* enough.
It struggles when:

- The user asks something the model already knows ("what day is
  today?"): the retrieval step is pure overhead.
- The user's phrasing doesn't match the corpus phrasing ("PTO
  policy" vs "vacation days"): one search misses; a reformulation
  might land.
- One topic is enough; another needs two searches against different
  tables.

An agent moves those decisions inside the loop. The model sees the
question, *decides* whether to retrieve, picks the table, writes a
query in its own words, reads the results, and may search again
before answering.

    F -->|"yes"| H
    F -->|"no, refine"| D
    F -->|"need a record's full body"| G["get_record_by_id"]
    G --> H
```

## The Three Tools

`synalinks.VectorRAGAgent` wraps a `FunctionCallingAgent` and
pre-wires three retrieval tools bound to a `KnowledgeBase`:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_knowledge_base_schema()` | List every table with its columns and descriptions. Used once to learn what's available. |
| `search_knowledge_base(table_name, query)` | Run the configured search (similarity / fulltext / hybrid_fts) against one table and return up to `k` hits. `k` is fixed per-agent at construction; the LM doesn't choose it per-call. |
| `get_record_by_id(table_name, record_id)` | After a search returns ids, fetch a full record. Useful when search snippets truncate long fields. |

The three tools cover the natural shape of retrieval: *what tables
exist → search one of them → optionally read a record in full*.

## Picking a Search Mode

`search_type` is a per-agent setting (the LM doesn't choose). It
shapes both the dispatch behaviour and the default instructions the
LM receives (so it phrases queries the right way).

| `search_type` | What it does | Use when |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| `"similarity"` | Pure vector search over embeddings. Requires an embedding model. | The corpus and the question use *different* words for the same concept (paraphrase-heavy). |
| `"fulltext"` | BM25 keyword search. No embedding model needed. | The words in the question are likely to appear verbatim in the documents (technical terms, named entities). |
| `"hybrid_fts"` (default) | Vector + BM25 fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Requires an embedding model. | You don't want to choose: RRF combines both signals and is the safest default. |

For each mode, the agent's default instructions tell the LM how to
phrase its queries: natural-language paraphrases for similarity,
keyword-rich strings for fulltext, both for hybrid.

## Output Format

Search results are returned as **CSV** by default (`output_format="csv"`),
which is dramatically more token-efficient than JSON for tabular
hits: no key names repeated per row. The LM reads CSV well, and on
modern providers it parses faster too. Switch to `"json"` if you
need list-of-dicts results for downstream code, but for purely
LM-facing flows CSV is the better default.

## Building the Agent

The constructor signature mirrors `FunctionCallingAgent` exactly:
every parameter on that class is accepted with identical semantics.
The additions are retrieval-specific:

| Param | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `knowledge_base` | yes | (none) | The `KnowledgeBase` to retrieve from. |
| `search_type` | no | `"hybrid_fts"` | `"similarity"`, `"fulltext"`, or `"hybrid_fts"`. |
| `k` | no | `5` | Top-k for searches. Fixed per-agent, not exposed to the LM. |
| `similarity_threshold` | no | `None` | Max vector distance for similarity / hybrid modes. |
| `fulltext_threshold` | no | `None` | Min BM25 score for fulltext / hybrid modes. |
| `output_format` | no | `"csv"` | `"csv"` (compact) or `"json"` (list of dicts). |
| `tools` | no | `None` | Extra `Tool` instances or async functions to append to the three built-ins. Same name-collision and no-leading-underscore rules as `FunctionCallingAgent`. |

```python
import synalinks

embedding_model = synalinks.EmbeddingModel(
    model="gemini/gemini-embedding-001",
)
kb = synalinks.KnowledgeBase(
    uri="duckdb://docs.db",
    data_models=[Document],
    embedding_model=embedding_model,
)
# ... populate kb ...

lm = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="ollama/qwen3:8b")

inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=synalinks.ChatMessages)
outputs = await synalinks.VectorRAGAgent(
    knowledge_base=kb,
    language_model=lm,
)(inputs)
agent = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```

Note: `"similarity"` and `"hybrid_fts"` modes need the knowledge
base to have an `embedding_model` set. `"fulltext"` works without
one.

## Layering Extra Tools

The `tools=` slot lets you append non-retrieval tools to the built-
in three. Useful when the answer mixes retrieved text with another
capability:

```python
@synalinks.saving.register_synalinks_serializable()
async def calculate(expression: str):
    \"\"\"Evaluate an arithmetic expression.

    Args:
        expression (str): A safe expression like '100 * 0.85'.
    \"\"\"
    if not all(char in "0123456789+-*/(). " for char in expression):
        return {"error": "Invalid characters in expression"}
    return {"result": eval(expression, {"__builtins__": None}, {})}

agent_module = synalinks.VectorRAGAgent(
    knowledge_base=kb,
    language_model=lm,
    tools=[synalinks.Tool(calculate)],
)
```

Now the LM can retrieve a pricing policy from the kb and then
compute a discount in the same turn.

## A Worked Example

A small end-to-end task: a kb of HR / pricing policies, and the
agent answers a question that needs both retrieval and arithmetic.

```python
result = await agent(synalinks.ChatMessages(messages=[synalinks.ChatMessage(
    role="user",
    content=(
        "If I have 100 users on the Enterprise plan, what would the "
        "per-user monthly cost be after the volume discount?"
    ),
)]))
```

What the agent typically does:

1. `search_knowledge_base("Document", "enterprise plan pricing volume discount")`:
   pulls the pricing-policy document.
2. The LM reads the discount tiers from the snippet.
3. `calculate("99 * (1 - 0.15)")`: applies the 15% discount.
4. Stops, produces the final natural-language answer.

If the first search doesn't return what the LM expected, it
reformulates and searches again. Multiple search rounds are normal
when the question's phrasing diverges from the corpus's.

## Multi-Turn Conversations

`VectorRAGAgent` accepts `ChatMessages` as input and threads context
across turns. Each turn the agent sees the full conversation, so it
can ground a follow-up against retrieval from a previous turn
without re-asking:

```python
messages = []
for user_msg in [
    "What's the daily meal allowance?",
    "What about international?",
    "I'm going for 3 days, what's my total budget?",
]:
    messages.append(synalinks.ChatMessage(role="user", content=user_msg))
    chat = synalinks.ChatMessages(messages=messages)
    result = await agent(chat)

    last = next(m for m in reversed(result.get("messages", []))
                if m.get("role") == "assistant" and m.get("content"))
    print("Agent:", last["content"])
    messages.append(synalinks.ChatMessage(role="assistant", content=last["content"]))
```

## Compared to Other Agents

`VectorRAGAgent` is one of several specialized agents that wrap a
`FunctionCallingAgent` with a workload-specific tool set:

| Agent | Bound to | Tools |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `FunctionCallingAgent` | nothing | whatever you pass in |
| `SQLAgent` | a `KnowledgeBase` | schema discovery, table sample, read-only SQL |
| `VectorRAGAgent` | a `KnowledgeBase` | schema discovery, similarity / fulltext / hybrid search, get-by-id |
| `DeepAgent` | a workdir | list, search, read, write, edit, bash |

When to pick `VectorRAGAgent` over `SQLAgent`: the data is *text*
(unstructured documents), and the question is "find me what's
relevant to X" rather than "compute Y from rows of Z". When the
data is structured (typed columns) and the answer needs joins or
aggregations, reach for `SQLAgent`.

You can also use both: give an agent a `KnowledgeBase` with both
document tables and structured tables, layer SQL tools on top of
retrieval, and let the LM mix them. But for a single workload, the
specialized agent is the simpler call.

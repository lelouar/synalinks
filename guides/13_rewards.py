# Rewards

Training, which we will meet in [Guide 15](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Training/), has one input you cannot
afford to choose carelessly: a **reward function** that tells the
optimizer how good each prediction was. Pick the wrong reward and
the optimizer cheerfully optimizes the wrong thing, happily, on
your dime. So before we get to the training loop itself, this
guide makes the reward concrete: what it is, what the built-ins
do, and how to write your own. Rewards are the steering wheel of
the entire training process; this guide is the chapter on
steering.

A **reward** in Synalinks is a function

    r : (y_true, y_pred) → [0, 1]

where `y_true` is the known correct answer (a `DataModel`
instance), `y_pred` is what the program produced (another
`DataModel` instance), and the output is a real number between
`0.0` and `1.0`. Higher is better; `1.0` means perfect; `0.0`
means worst. Rewards play the role that *negative loss* plays in
classical machine learning, but with one crucial difference:
**they do not need to be differentiable.** We never take their
derivative.

That non-differentiability is liberating. A reward can call a
regex, run a unit test, ask another LM to grade the answer, hit
a real database, anything you can express in async Python. The
optimizer treats the reward as a black box and only cares about
the scalar it returns.

## The Picture, In One Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    P["program(x)"] --> Y["y_pred"]
    G["ground truth"] --> T["y_true"]
    T --> R["reward(y_true, y_pred)"]
    Y --> R
    R --> S["scalar in [0, 1]"]
    S --> O["Optimizer"]
```

One forward pass through the program produces `y_pred`. The
training loop hands `y_true` (from your dataset) and `y_pred`
to the reward, gets back a scalar, and gives it to the optimizer
to score the configuration that produced it.

## The Anatomy of a Reward

Every reward inherits from `synalinks.Reward` and accepts the
same handful of constructor arguments. The most important ones:

- **`in_mask=["field_a", "field_b"]`**: *whitelist*. Only the
  named fields of `y_true` / `y_pred` participate in the score;
  everything else is ignored.
- **`out_mask=["thinking"]`**: *blacklist*. Drop the named
  fields before scoring; keep the rest.
- **`in_mask_pattern=r"^answer.*"`**: like `in_mask` but the
  field set is described by a regex (regular expression, a
  short language for matching text patterns). Useful when you
  have a lot of fields with a common prefix.
- **`out_mask_pattern=r".*_thinking$"`**: same idea, for the
  blacklist side.
- **`reduction="mean"`**: how the per-sample rewards in a
  batch are reduced to a single scalar in the progress logs.
  Valid values are `"mean"` (the default), `"sum"`, `"min"`,
  `"max"`, and `"none"`. `"min"` scores by the worst sample in
  the batch, pessimistic; `"max"` scores by the best,
  optimistic / best-of-N. The per-sample values are always
  preserved for the optimizer; reduction only affects the
  number you see in the log and the number used to compare
  candidates.

You will almost always use `in_mask` or `out_mask` to focus the
reward on the field that actually matters. Without it, an answer
that gets the final `answer` right but has a slightly different
`thinking` string would still score `0.0` under `ExactMatch`,
because *every* field has to match.

## The Four Built-In Rewards

Synalinks ships four reward types out of the box. They cover the
common cases; for anything else, you write a small async
function and wrap it (next section).

### 1. `ExactMatch`: strict equality

The simplest reward there is. Compare the JSON of `y_pred` with
the JSON of `y_true`; return `1.0` if they are equal, else
`0.0`.

```python
reward = synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(in_mask=["answer"])
```

`ExactMatch` is **discrete**: its only possible values are `0`
or `1`, and that bluntness is both its strength and its weak
spot. The strength: when the right answer is clearly defined
(a number, a label, a name), exact equality is exactly the
right standard. The weak spot: an answer that is *almost*
right scores the same as one that is wildly wrong, which gives
the optimizer no gradient to climb. If the task allows it, a
smoother reward like cosine similarity is easier to learn from.

A second sharp edge: `ExactMatch` does literal string equality.
Trailing whitespace, units, capitalization, and Unicode
normalization all matter. `"42 "` does not equal `"42"`, and
`"Paris"` does not equal `"paris"`. The mitigation is to lock
down the output schema ([Guide 2](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Data%20Models/)) so the LM produces stable
formats, and to use `in_mask` to focus on the field where
strict equality is genuinely the right test.

### 2. `CosineSimilarity`: meaning, not letters

A reward that scores `y_true` and `y_pred` by **semantic**
similarity. It embeds both into vectors using an embedding
model, measures the angle between them, and returns a number
in `[0, 1]`.

```python
reward = synalinks.rewards.CosineSimilarity(
    embedding_model=embedding_model,
    in_mask=["answer"],
)
```

The exact formula is

    r = (cos(emb(y_true), emb(y_pred)) + 1) / 2

The `+1` and `/2` rescale the usual cosine similarity (which
lives in `[-1, 1]`) into `[0, 1]` so it composes cleanly with
the other rewards. `1.0` means "embeddings point in the same
direction"; `0.5` means orthogonal; `0.0` means opposite.

Use `CosineSimilarity` when:

- Paraphrases of the right answer should still earn credit
  ("The capital of France is Paris" vs "Paris").
- The output is free-form text and exact-match is too strict.
- You want a smooth signal the optimizer can climb gradually.

Two cautions:

- **Embeddings cost money.** Every reward call embeds two
  strings. On a long-running training loop this adds up
  quickly. Pick a cheap embedding model unless you have
  measured that you need a stronger one.
- **The scale is the cosine scale.** A score of `0.7` on a
  scaled cosine is "moderately similar," not "70% right."
  Calibrate your expectations to the metric, not to a
  classroom grading scheme.

### 3. `LMAsJudge`: ask a second model

When the task is too open-ended for exact-match and too
nuanced for cosine, for instance, "is this summary
helpful?" or "did the assistant follow the policy?", let
*another* LM grade the output:

```python
reward = synalinks.rewards.LMAsJudge(
    language_model=judge_model,
    instructions="Score the answer on accuracy and clarity. "
                 "Return a single number in [0, 1].",
)
```

Under the hood `LMAsJudge` is just a `Program` (the
`LMAsJudgeProgram` class) wrapped as a reward, a wrapper
called `ProgramAsJudge`. The judge sees both `y_true` and
`y_pred` (or just `y_pred` if no ground truth is provided), and
returns a numeric score that the framework normalizes to
`[0, 1]`.

By default the judge picks from `synalinks.FineScore` (twenty-one
values from 0.0 to 1.0, step 0.05). If your rubric reads more
naturally as a rating, pass `score_type=synalinks.Rating` (1 to 5),
`Rating10`, `Rating20`, or the coarser `Score`:

```python
reward = synalinks.rewards.LMAsJudge(
    language_model=judge_model,
    score_type=synalinks.Rating,
)
```

The judge's default instructions and output schema follow the
chosen scale, and the reward is still normalized to `[0, 1]`,
so optimizers and metrics see no difference.

Three things to know about LM judges:

- **They are the most flexible reward.** You can grade things
  like helpfulness, tone, format compliance, or anything else
  a regex cannot capture.
- **They are the most expensive.** Every reward call costs
  another LM call. Pair them with a cheap, fast judge model.
- **They are the noisiest.** The judge can be wrong; biases
  in the judge become biases in the optimizer. Always spot-
  check a sample of the judge's verdicts against a human.

### 4. Custom rewards via `RewardFunctionWrapper`

For everything else, write a plain async function and wrap it:

```python
@synalinks.saving.register_synalinks_serializable()
async def length_under(y_true, y_pred, limit=200):
    \"\"\"Score 1.0 if the answer is under `limit` characters, else 0.0.\"\"\"
    answer = y_pred.get("answer", "")
    return 1.0 if len(answer) <= limit else 0.0

reward = synalinks.rewards.RewardFunctionWrapper(
    fn=length_under,
    limit=200,
    name="length_under_200",
)
```

The function signature is `fn(y_true, y_pred, **kwargs)`. Any
keyword arguments you pass to the wrapper are forwarded to the
function on every call. The function must be `async` because
the wrapper awaits it.

When you need none of that (no forwarded arguments, no mask, no
custom `reduction`), skip the wrapper and hand the function
straight to `compile`:

```python
program.compile(
    reward=length_under,
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.RandomFewShot(),
)
```

Synalinks wraps it for you and names the reward after the
function. Forget the `async` and you get a `TypeError` naming
your function, instead of a puzzling failure mid-training.

The decorator
`@synalinks.saving.register_synalinks_serializable()` is what
lets your custom reward survive `program.save(...)` /
`Program.load(...)` ([Guide 3](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Programs/)): without it, the loader will not
know how to reconstruct the function.

### Bonus: combining rewards

Want both exact-match *and* a length penalty? Wrap them in a
function:

```python
exact = synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(in_mask=["answer"])

@synalinks.saving.register_synalinks_serializable()
async def exact_and_short(y_true, y_pred):
    em = await exact(y_true, y_pred)
    short = 1.0 if len(y_pred.get("answer", "")) < 80 else 0.0
    return 0.7 * em + 0.3 * short

reward = synalinks.rewards.RewardFunctionWrapper(fn=exact_and_short)
```

The optimizer sees a single number, just as before. You have
hidden a multi-objective reward inside a one-dimensional
scalar with weights you chose.

## Batched Rewards: when samples need each other

The four rewards above score each sample in isolation. Some
ideas, group-relative scores, batch normalization, paired
comparisons, need to see the whole batch at once. For those
cases there is `BatchReward`:

```python
class GroupRelativeReward(synalinks.BatchReward):
    async def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        # y_true and y_pred are LISTS of length batch_size.
        # Must return a list[float] of the same length.
        raw = [await score_single(t, p) for t, p in zip(y_true, y_pred)]
        mean = sum(raw) / max(1, len(raw))
        return [r - mean for r in raw]   # centered around the batch mean
```

A `BatchReward` subclass receives the **entire batch** at once
and must return one reward per sample. Use it when the meaning
of "good" depends on what the *other* samples in the batch did,
for instance, "this answer is better than the median of
its peers." A `BatchRewardFunctionWrapper` exists for the
common case where you only want to wrap a stateless function.

For most tasks you will not need `BatchReward`. The default
sample-by-sample rewards are simpler to write, faster, and
easier to debug.

## Picking a Reward: a Short Decision Tree

When you do not know which reward to start with, walk this
ladder top to bottom and stop at the first match:

1. **The right answer is a fixed value or label?** Use
   `ExactMatch(in_mask=[field])`.
2. **The right answer is open-ended text where paraphrases
   should earn credit?** Use `CosineSimilarity` with a cheap
   embedding model.
3. **The "right answer" is a judgment call: helpfulness,
   tone, policy compliance?** Use `LMAsJudge` with a small
   judge model. Spot-check the judge.
4. **None of the above?** Write a custom function and wrap it
   with `RewardFunctionWrapper`. If the score depends on the
   whole batch at once, subclass `BatchReward` instead.

## Failure Modes Worth Watching For

- **The reward is constantly `0.0`.** Usually a schema
  mismatch: the field you put in `in_mask` does not exist on
  the output, or the type of the field does not match. Print
  one `(y_pred, y_true)` pair before training to confirm.
- **The reward saturates at `1.0` instantly.** The task is
  too easy for this model: there is no signal left for the
  optimizer to chase. Make the task harder, the reward
  stricter, or move on.
- **The reward rewards the wrong thing.** Classic
  *reward hacking*: the LM learns to game the metric without
  actually getting better at the task. Symptom: training
  reward keeps rising, but a human reading the outputs sees
  them getting worse. Mitigation: spot-check outputs by hand
  every few epochs; add a second, sanity-check reward and
  watch them together.
- **The reward depends on a non-deterministic resource.**
  Using `LMAsJudge` with a high-temperature judge, or a
  reward that hits a flaky web API, produces noisy scores
  that confuse the optimizer. Use a deterministic judge
  (`temperature=0.0`) where you can.

## Take-Home Summary

- A **reward** is a function `(y_true, y_pred) → [0, 1]`.
  Higher is better. Non-differentiable is fine; we never
  take its derivative.
- **`in_mask` / `out_mask`** focus the reward on the
  field(s) that actually matter. Regex variants
  (`in_mask_pattern`, `out_mask_pattern`) handle dynamic
  field sets.
- The **four built-ins** cover most needs:
  `ExactMatch` (strict), `CosineSimilarity` (semantic),
  `LMAsJudge` (judgment calls), and
  `RewardFunctionWrapper` (anything else).
- **`BatchReward`** is the escape hatch when the score needs
  to look at the whole batch at once (group-relative scores,
  paired comparisons). Most tasks do not need it.
- **Reward design *is* task design.** A blunt 0/1 reward
  gives the optimizer no gradient; a smooth reward is easier
  to climb. Spot-check outputs by hand to catch reward
  hacking before it metastasizes.

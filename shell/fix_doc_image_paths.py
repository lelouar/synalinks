"""Post-build fix for asset links in the Zensical-built ``site/``.

Zensical (through mkdocstrings) miscomputes the relative depth of image links
that come from Python **docstrings** rendered by ``:::`` reference blocks: it
emits one ``../`` too many for ``examples.*`` pages and two too many for the
deeper ``synalinks.*`` API pages, deriving the count from the object's dotted
identifier instead of the page's URL. The page's own CSS/JS links are correct,
so the bug is specific to docstring-injected images.

At a root deploy the extra ``../`` is harmlessly clamped at ``/``, but the docs
publish under the ``/synalinks/`` project-pages sub-path (see ``site_url`` in
``mkdocs.yml``), so the surplus ``../`` climbs *past* ``/synalinks/`` to the
domain root and every such image 404s.

Every asset lives at ``site/assets/``, so the correct number of ``../`` for any
page is exactly its directory depth below ``site/``. This pass rewrites the
leading ``./``/``../`` run of every ``assets/...`` link (and only those; it
leaves ``http(s)://`` and root-absolute ``/assets`` links untouched) to match
that depth. Links that were already correct (CSS, nav) normalize to themselves.

Run after ``zensical build`` and before publishing.

# Differences with Keras
## A Complete Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for translating **Keras** concepts into **Synalinks**. While **Keras** is designed for building traditional neural networks with tensor operations, **Synalinks** is a framework for creating **neuro-symbolic programs** that combine language models with structured reasoning.

## Fundamental Paradigm Shift

### Keras: Neural Network Framework
- **Purpose**: Build and train deep neural networks using tensor operations
- **Core abstraction**: Mathematical tensors flowing through differentiable layers
- **Training**: Gradient-based optimization (backpropagation)
- **Computation**: Matrix multiplications and activation functions
- **Use cases**: Computer vision, time series, traditional ML tasks

### Synalinks: Neuro-Symbolic LM Framework
- **Purpose**: Build intelligent applications combining LMs with symbolic reasoning
- **Core abstraction**: Structured JSON data flowing through modular programs
- **Training**: Reinforcement learning with LM-based optimizers
- **Computation**: Language model inference + symbolic operations
- **Use cases**: AI agents, reasoning systems, structured generation, API orchestration

## Quick Concept Mapping

| **Keras Concept** | **Synalinks Equivalent** | **Key Difference** |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `Layer` | `Module` | Processes JSON instead of tensors |
| `Model` | `Program` | DAG of modules with conditional logic |
| `Tensor` | `Data Model` | JSON object with schema validation |
| Tensor shape | JSON schema | Explicit structure definition |
| Weights/biases | `Trainable Variable` | JSON objects, not floating-point arrays |
| Loss function | Reward function | Maximize reward vs minimize loss |
| Backpropagation | LM-based optimization | No gradients; uses language model reasoning |
| `model.compile()` | `program.compile()` | Sets up LM optimizer instead of SGD/Adam |
| `model.fit()` | `program.fit()` | Reinforcement learning loop |

## Core Concepts Explained

### Module (Layer Equivalent)
A **Module** is a self-contained computational unit that:
- **Receives**: JSON Data Models conforming to input schemas
- **Processes**: Via LM calls, symbolic operations, or hybrid approaches
- **Outputs**: JSON Data Models conforming to output schemas

#### Key Module Properties:
- **Keras Layer**: Receives tensors, performs matrix operations, outputs tensors
- **Synalinks Module**: Receives JSON, performs LM/symbolic operations, outputs JSON with schema validation

### Program (Model Equivalent)
A **Program** orchestrates multiple Modules into a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

#### Keras Model vs Synalinks Program:
- **Keras**: Fixed computation graph of tensor operations
- **Synalinks**: Dynamic graph with conditional branching based on LM decisions

In Keras, you build sequential or functional models with fixed layer connections. In **Synalinks**, you create programs that can include conditional branches, where different modules execute based on LM-driven decisions or data conditions.

### Data Models & JSON Schemas

Instead of implicit tensor shapes, **Synalinks** uses **explicit JSON schemas**:

- **Keras**: Input shape defined as dimensions (e.g., 784-dimensional vector)
- **Synalinks**: Input structure defined as JSON schema with explicit fields, types, and validation rules

**Why JSON?**
- **Interpretability**: Human-readable intermediate states
- **Validation**: Built-in schema validation
- **Interoperability**: Native compatibility with APIs and web services
- **Debugging**: Easy to inspect and modify
- **Structured generation**: Natural fit for LM constrained output

## Training Paradigm Differences

### Keras: Gradient Descent
- Defines differentiable loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy)
- Computes gradients via automatic differentiation (backpropagation)
- Updates weights using gradient information through optimizers like Adam or SGD
- Requires continuous, differentiable operations throughout

### Synalinks: LM-Based Optimization
- Defines reward function (higher values indicate better performance)
- No gradient computation; uses language models to reason about improvements
- LM analyzes current performance and proposes better configurations
- Updates trainable variables (JSON objects) based on LM suggestions
- Can incorporate discrete decisions and non-differentiable operations

### Key Training Differences:

| **Aspect** | **Keras** | **Synalinks** |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Objective** | Minimize loss | Maximize reward |
| **Optimization** | Gradient descent | Reinforcement learning |
| **Update mechanism** | Mathematical derivatives | LM-generated improvements |
| **Trainable params** | Float tensors | Structured JSON objects |

## When to Use Each Framework

### Use Keras when:
- Working with numerical data (images, signals, time series)
- Need fast, vectorized computations
- Have large labeled datasets
- Problem has clear differentiable objectives
- Deploying to edge devices with limited resources

### Use Synalinks when:
- Building LM-powered applications
- Need symbolic reasoning and logic
- Working with structured/semi-structured text data
- Require interpretable intermediate steps
- Building API orchestration or agent systems
- Need adaptive, context-aware processing
- Want to combine multiple LMs and tools

## Summary

While Keras excels at building traditional neural networks with tensor operations and gradient-based training, **Synalinks** is designed for a fundamentally different purpose: creating **neuro-symbolic applications** that combine the reasoning capabilities of language models with structured, validated data processing.

The shift from tensors to JSON, from gradients to LM-based optimization, and from fixed architectures to adaptive programs represents not just a technical change, but a paradigm shift in how we think about building intelligent systems. **Synalinks** is ideal when you need interpretability, flexibility, and the ability to integrate language understanding with symbolic reasoning, making it perfect for next-generation AI applications.

# Deep Agent

[Guide 6](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Agents/) introduced the agent loop: decide, act, observe, repeat.
That loop is general: as long as you give it a set of typed tools,
the model can reason about *anything*. This guide picks a specific
useful shape for those tools: a workspace on disk. The result is a
**deep agent**: an agent that treats a directory as its environment,
reading and editing files and running Python inside a sandboxed,
copy-on-write copy of it.

In other words: where `FunctionCallingAgent` calls a few narrow
helpers (a calculator, a clock), a deep agent has a small but
complete toolbox for *working on code*: the same shape of tools
that drive AI coding assistants like Claude Code, Devin, Aider.

## When Do You Want One?

The agent loop has the same four phases everywhere (think, decide,
act, observe) but the *act* phase looks very different depending on
what tools you give it:

- A RAG agent acts by searching documents.
- An SQL agent acts by writing SELECT queries.
- A deep agent acts by **changing the filesystem**: reading source
  files, patching them, running them, looking at the output.

That makes deep agents a fit for tasks where the answer cannot be
expressed in a single output: it has to *exist* somewhere in a
workspace by the time the loop ends. Bug fixes, refactors, scaffolds,
data-wrangling pipelines, exploratory code reviews, anything where
"the result is some new state in the workspace" is the right ending.

## The Six Tools

`synalinks.DeepAgent` wraps a `FunctionCallingAgent` and pre-wires
six tools, all bound to a single working directory you supply:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_files(pattern)` | List files matching a glob (e.g. `**/*.py`). |
| `search_files(pattern, glob)` | Grep file *contents* by regex across files matching a glob. Returns `(path, line_number, line)` matches. |
| `read_file(path, offset, limit)` | Line-paginated file read. Output carries 1-based `start_line` / `end_line`, so the LM can cite line numbers later without re-reading. |
| `write_file(path, content)` | Create or overwrite a file (in the sandbox filesystem). |
| `edit_file(path, old, new)` | Replace an exact substring; rejects 0 or 2+ occurrences so the LM has to add surrounding context to disambiguate (pass `replace_all=True` to override). |
| `run_bash(command)` | Run a shell command against the sandbox filesystem: pipes, redirects, globs, `&&`, loops, and `python3` (a real interpreter with the full standard library, third-party packages, and network). Write a script with `write_file`, then run it with `python3 script.py`. |

Two design choices are worth highlighting:

1. **Line-paginated reads, line-numbered output.** `read_file` does
   not return character-offset slices. It returns lines, with 1-based
   `start_line` / `end_line` markers. The model thinks in terms of
   lines, edits are usually targeted at a line, so the read tool's
   output should match. The line numbers also mean a model can
   `read_file` once and then `edit_file` referencing the exact text
   it just saw, without re-reading to confirm. Page through long files
   with `offset` / `limit`.

2. **`list_files` globs, `search_files` greps.** `list_files` answers
   "what files are there?" (a glob over paths); `search_files` answers
   "where does this pattern appear?": a regex over file *contents*,
   restricted to a glob, returning `(path, line_number, line)` matches.
   Two narrow tools instead of one overloaded one keeps the LM's choice
   shallow: it picks by intent, not by guessing what an empty argument
   means.

## The Security Model

Here is the single idea that makes the deep agent safe to point at a
real directory: **the tools operate on a sandboxed, copy-on-write
copy of the workdir, never the workdir itself.**

### A copy-on-write filesystem, seeded from your workdir

`DeepAgent` mounts the workdir in a `MirageSandbox`. The agent sees your
project as it is (`read_file`, `list_files`, `search_files` resolve
against the mounted copy) but every mutation (`write_file`, `edit_file`,
and anything `run_bash` writes) lands in the sandbox's **copy-on-write
filesystem**, never on the real disk. The host workspace is never
modified. (Paths are rooted at the workdir, so the agent stays inside
the directory you mounted.)

That means there is no capability to gate: the agent cannot damage the
host through its tools, because nothing it does is written back to disk.
All six tools are therefore always available.

### Code runs in an isolated subprocess, not on the host

`run_bash` does not shell out to your machine. It runs in **Mirage**:
an isolated, confined CPython subprocess with the workdir mounted as the
copy-on-write filesystem. The `python3` it exposes is a *real*
interpreter (full standard library, third-party packages, even network),
so the agent can write and run ordinary scripts, but its writes stay in
the sandbox filesystem, and confinement (seccomp, read-only host binds,
an egress allowlist) bounds what it can reach. `timeout` (default 30s)
bounds each execution.

The containment is structural (a sandboxed filesystem plus a confined
subprocess) rather than a set of `allow_write` / `allow_bash` gates you
could forget to turn on.

### Inspecting and persisting what the agent did

Because changes live in the sandbox filesystem, you read them back
through the sandbox rather than off disk. The `DeepAgent` instance
exposes it as `agent.sandbox`:

- `agent.sandbox.changes()` → `{"written": [...], "deleted": [...]}`,
  a summary of the final sandbox state.
- `agent.sandbox.diff()` → per-path detail of every change
  (`{"path", "kind", "size"}`) against the seeded workdir.
- `await agent.sandbox.read_file(path)` → `{"content": ...}`, the
  effective content for a path (sandbox value if written, else the
  seeded file).

If you want any of it on disk, persist it yourself from those reads.

## Building the Agent

The constructor signature mirrors `FunctionCallingAgent` exactly:
every parameter on that class is accepted with identical semantics.
The additions are workspace-specific:

| Param | Required | Default | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| `workdir` | yes | (none) | Must exist and be a directory. Mounted read-through in the sandbox; the agent's writes/edits stay in the overlay and never touch it. (Omit it for an empty in-memory workspace.) |
| `timeout` | no | `30.0` | Per-execution budget in seconds for `run_bash`. |
| `tools` | no | `None` | Extra `Tool` instances or async functions to append to the built-ins. Same name-collision and no-leading-underscore rules as `FunctionCallingAgent`. |

```python
import synalinks

lm = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="ollama/qwen3:8b")

inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=synalinks.ChatMessages)
outputs = await synalinks.DeepAgent(
    workdir="/tmp/my_project",
    language_model=lm,
)(inputs)
agent = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
```

You don't need a "read-only mode" to point this at a precious
directory: the copy-on-write overlay already guarantees the real
workdir is never modified, so even when the agent writes, edits, and
runs code, your files on disk stay exactly as they were. To review
what it *would* have changed, read `agent.sandbox.changes()` after the
run.

## A Worked Example

A small end-to-end task: scaffold a Python file, ask the agent to
extend it, and verify the agent's change actually runs. Keep a
reference to the `DeepAgent` instance; its `sandbox` is where the
overlay changes live, so that is where you read the result (the file
on disk is never touched).

```python
import asyncio, os, tempfile
import synalinks

workdir = tempfile.mkdtemp(prefix="deep_demo_")
with open(os.path.join(workdir, "calculator.py"), "w") as f:
    f.write("def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n")

lm = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="ollama/qwen3:8b")
inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=synalinks.ChatMessages)
deep = synalinks.DeepAgent(
    workdir=workdir,
    language_model=lm,
    max_iterations=10,
)
outputs = await deep(inputs)
agent = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

task = synalinks.ChatMessages(messages=[synalinks.ChatMessage(
    role="user",
    content=(
        "Open calculator.py, add a `multiply(a, b)` function and an "
        '`if __name__ == "__main__":` block that prints `multiply(6, 7)`, '
        "then use `run_bash` to run `python3 calculator.py` to confirm "
        "it prints 42."
    ),
)])
result = await agent(task)

# Changes live in the sandbox filesystem, not on disk; inspect via the sandbox:
print(deep.sandbox.changes())                       # {'written': ['/calculator.py'], ...}
print((await deep.sandbox.read_file("calculator.py"))["content"])
```

What the agent will typically do:

1. `read_file("calculator.py")`: see the current source, with line
   markers.
2. `edit_file("calculator.py", "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n", "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    return a * b\n")`,
   or write the whole file with `write_file`. The model picks.
3. `run_bash("python3 calculator.py")`: run the file in the sandbox to
   verify it prints 42. (Run a script *file*: a `python3 -c` snippet
   can't import the overlay's modules; only file execution sees them.)
4. Stop calling tools; produce the final assistant message.

If the verify step fails (syntax error, wrong number printed), the
agent reads the result, edits again, re-runs. The iteration cap
is the only thing that stops it from looping forever; in practice a
correct change usually lands in 2-3 tool calls.

## Compared to Other Agents

`DeepAgent` is one of several specialized agents that all wrap a
`FunctionCallingAgent` with a workload-specific tool set:

| Agent | Bound to | Tools |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `FunctionCallingAgent` | nothing | whatever you pass in |
| `SQLAgent` | a `KnowledgeBase` | schema discovery, table sample, read-only SQL |
| `VectorRAGAgent` | a `KnowledgeBase` | schema discovery, semantic/keyword search, get-by-id |
| `DeepAgent` | a workdir | list, search, read, write, edit, run Python |

All four accept the same `FunctionCallingAgent` parameters plus
their domain-specific extras. The same `tools=` slot is available on
all of them for layering extra tools on top of the built-ins.

When to pick which:

- **SQLAgent**: data lives in a structured DB; the answer is a
  computation over rows.
- **VectorRAGAgent**: data lives as documents; the answer is a
  synthesis grounded in retrieval.
- **DeepAgent**: the answer is a *change* to a workspace, or a
  diagnosis that requires running code.
- **FunctionCallingAgent**: you have a bespoke tool set that doesn't
  match any of the above.

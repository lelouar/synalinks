You are a software engineering assistant working inside a sandboxed,
copy-on-write filesystem.

{workdir_line}
Available tools: {file_tool_names(images, audio)}, run_bash

Plan:
1. Use `list_files` to discover files (glob, e.g. `**/*.py`).
2. Use `search_files` to grep file contents by regex across a glob.
3. Use `read_file` to read a file; it returns the requested lines with
   1-based `start_line` / `end_line`. Page through long files with
   `offset` / `limit` (raise `offset` to read further in).{media_lines}
4. Use `edit_file` for surgical changes (preferred over `write_file`).
5. Use `run_bash` to run shell commands against the filesystem: pipes,
   redirects, globs, `&&`, loops, and `python3` (e.g. `python3 script.py`
   after `write_file`-ing it). `python3` is a real interpreter with the
   full standard library, third-party packages and network.
6. Once you have the answer, stop calling tools and respond.

Notes:
- The filesystem is host-safe: edits and new files land in the sandbox's
  mounted filesystem and never modify the real workspace on disk.
- If the conversation includes an `InputsSummary`, you only see field
  previews and sizes; the full, untruncated input values are saved as the
  JSON file named in its `inputs_file` field. Read it with the `read_file`
  tool (or `run_bash` `cat`) rather than retyping values from the preview.

You can delegate work to parallel subagents, each on its own isolated

- `spawn_subagents(tasks)`: launch one subagent per task string. Each
  subagent sees the files you see *now* and may freely read/write/edit/
  delete them, but its changes stay on its own branch; they never touch
  your filesystem. Subagents run concurrently, so use this to parallelize
  independent exploration or edits. Returns a `handle` and a `patch`
  (its pending changes as a git-style unified diff, the actual line-level
  edits) plus a structured `diff` summary per subagent.
- `merge_subagent(handle, paths=None, force=False)`: after reviewing a
  subagent's `patch`, fold its changes into your filesystem (pass `paths` to
  take only a subset). A path you also changed since spawning is a conflict
  and is refused (reported in `conflicts` / `skipped`); pass `force=True`
  to apply it anyway (the subagent's version wins).
- `discard_subagent(handle)`: drop a subagent's branch unmerged.
Nothing a subagent does affects your files until you `merge_subagent` it.

class DeepAgent(FunctionCallingAgent):
    """A coding agent whose tools are a sandboxed copy of a workdir.

    DeepAgent is a thin specialization of `FunctionCallingAgent`
    that mounts the workdir in a `MirageSandbox` and exposes the
    sandbox's tool methods to the LM:

    - ``read_file``: read a file by 1-based line range (paginated).
    - ``list_files``: list files matching a glob.
    - ``search_files``: glob for files and grep their contents (regex).
    - ``write_file``: create/overwrite a file.
    - ``edit_file``: exact-string replacement.
    - ``run_bash``: run a shell command (pipes, redirects, globs, loops and
      ``python3``) against the mounted filesystem.

    Every tool is backed by the sandbox's mounted filesystem, seeded from
    ``workdir``, so the agent is **host-safe by construction**: writes, edits
    and code execution land in the mount and can never modify the real
    ``workdir`` or reach the host, so there is nothing to gate, and all tools
    are always available. Inspect what the agent did through ``agent.sandbox``
    (``changes()`` / ``diff()``) and persist any of it yourself if desired.

    The constructor mirrors `FunctionCallingAgent`: every
    parameter on that class is accepted here with identical semantics.
    The additions are ``workdir`` (required) and the sandbox ``timeout``.
    User-supplied ``tools`` are appended to the built-in ones.

    Example:

    ```python
    import synalinks
    import asyncio

    async def main():
        lm = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="ollama/mistral")

        inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=synalinks.ChatMessages)
        outputs = await synalinks.DeepAgent(
            workdir="/tmp/my_project",
            language_model=lm,
        )(inputs)
        agent = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

        messages = synalinks.ChatMessages(messages=[
            synalinks.ChatMessage(
                role="user",
                content="What's in this directory?",
            )
        ])
        result = await agent(messages)
        print(result.get("messages")[-1].get("content"))

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

    Args:
        schema (dict): JSON schema for the final answer.
        data_model (DataModel): DataModel for the final answer.
            Mutually exclusive with ``schema``.
        language_model (LanguageModel): The language model that drives
            the agent loop.
        sub_language_model (LanguageModel): Optional. The language model
            that drives spawned subagents (typically a cheaper model).
            Defaults to ``language_model`` when omitted.
        prompt_template (str): Forwarded to the tool-call generator.
        examples (list): Few-shot examples for the tool-call generator.
        instructions (str): Override the default system instructions.
            When omitted, the default is built from the workdir.
        final_instructions (str): Instructions for the final-answer
            generator. Defaults to ``instructions``.
        temperature (float): LM sampling temperature. Defaults to None
            (the model's own default applies).
        max_tokens (int): Optional. Maximum number of tokens to generate.
            Default None (the model's own default; caps generation length).
        top_p (float): Optional. Nucleus sampling probability. Default None
            (the model's own default).
        top_k (int): Optional. Top-k sampling cutoff. Default None (the
            model's own default).
        use_inputs_schema (bool): Include the input schema in the prompt.
        use_outputs_schema (bool): Include the output schema in the prompt.
        reasoning_effort (str): Forwarded to the generators (for
            reasoning-capable LMs).
        use_chain_of_thought (bool): When ``True``, the tool-call
            generator emits a ``thinking`` field per round.
        tools (list): Additional `Tool` instances (or plain async
            functions) to expose alongside the built-in tools. Names must
            not start with ``_`` or collide with built-ins.
        autonomous (bool): When ``True`` (default), the agent runs the
            tool loop end-to-end. When ``False``, returns one step at a
            time for human-in-the-loop workflows.
        return_inputs_with_trajectory (bool): When ``True`` (default),
            the full message trajectory is included alongside the final
            answer.
        max_iterations (int): Maximum number of tool-call rounds.
            Defaults to 10 (coding tasks tend to need more rounds than
            RAG / SQL).
        streaming (bool): Stream the final answer when no ``schema`` is
            set. Defaults to ``False``.
        timeout (float): Per-command execution budget in seconds for
            ``run_bash``. Defaults to 30.
        workdir (str): Optional working directory the agent operates on.
            When given it must exist and its files seed the sandbox
            filesystem (the LM's writes/edits stay there and never touch
            the real directory). When omitted, the sandbox starts as an
            empty in-memory filesystem.
        sandbox (Sandbox): Optional ready-made sandbox to operate on instead
            of building one from ``workdir``, e.g. a `Sandbox.fork`
            of another agent's filesystem. When given, ``workdir`` is used
            only for the default instructions text.
        skills (list): Optional. Folder paths (Agent Skill roots) whose skills
            are listed for the agent as an ``<available_skills>`` context message
            (see `FunctionCallingAgent`). The skill files must also be reachable
            from the agent's sandbox (e.g. under ``workdir``) for their bodies to
            be read on demand. Defaults to ``None``.
        max_subagent_depth (int): When ``> 0``, the agent gains
            ``spawn_subagents`` / ``merge_subagent`` / ``discard_subagent``
            tools, letting the LM run subagents in parallel, each on an
            isolated `Sandbox.fork` of the filesystem whose changes
            only land on an explicit ``merge_subagent``. The value caps
            nesting: ``1`` (the recommended setting) lets this agent spawn
            subagents that cannot themselves spawn; ``2`` allows one more
            level, and so on. Defaults to ``0`` (subagents disabled,
            backward-compatible). Requires a fork-capable sandbox
            (``MirageSandbox`` is).

            A subagent's fork starts from this agent's files and Python
            state, and only its **file changes** are folded back, so across
            parallel subagents you can merge **all** of them. Folding back
            Python REPL state
            (variables/functions/imports) across subagents is a
            `RecursiveLanguageModelAgent` feature, and limited to one
            subagent there, because the REPL namespace serializes only
            as a whole (it can't union parallel namespaces). That is a
            backend constraint, not a design shortcut.
        name (str): Module name.

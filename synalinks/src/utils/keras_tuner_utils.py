"""Synalinks-aware wrappers around the standard `keras_tuner` tuners.

`keras_tuner.RandomSearch` (and friends) are designed for Keras models:
their default `run_trial` builds a model via `hypermodel(hp)` and calls
`model.fit(...)`. Synalinks programs work the same way but their `fit`
is `async`, and `program.fit` returns a `synalinks.callbacks.History`
that `keras_tuner` does not recognize (its `isinstance` check is against
the stubbed `keras.callbacks.History`).

The wrappers here override `run_trial` to:

1. Build the program by calling `tuner.hypermodel.build(hp)`: the
   hypermodel may return either a `synalinks.Program` directly or a
   coroutine that resolves to one.
2. Run `await program.fit(*args, **kwargs)` with whatever the user passed
   to `tuner.search(...)`.
3. Reduce the resulting `History` into a flat metrics dict keyed by
   metric name and return it. The oracle's objective(s) get the
   best-across-epochs value (max for "max" direction, min for "min");
   non-objective metrics get their final-epoch value (informational).

Everything else (oracle plumbing, trial persistence, `get_best_hyperparameters`)
comes for free from `keras_tuner`.

Usage:

```python
import synalinks
synalinks.disable_keras_backend()   # must come before kt is imported

async def build_program(hp):
    inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Query)
    outputs = await synalinks.Generator(
        data_model=Answer,
        language_model=language_model,
        temperature=hp.Float("temperature", 0.0, 1.0),
    )(inputs)
    program = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    program.compile(reward=synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch())
    return program

tuner = synalinks.tuners.RandomSearch(
    hypermodel=build_program,
    objective=synalinks.tuners.Objective("val_reward", direction="max"),
    max_trials=5,
    directory="runs",
    project_name="my_search",
)
tuner.search(
    x=x_train,
    y=y_train,
    validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=4,
)
best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
```

`keras_tuner` is an optional dependency. Importing this module does **not**
import `keras_tuner`: the kt subclasses are built lazily on the first
instantiation of `RandomSearch` / `BayesianOptimization` / `Hyperband` /
`GridSearch`. If `keras_tuner` (and either real Keras or the
`disable_keras_backend()` stub) cannot be loaded then, a clear error is
raised pointing the user at the fix.

    keras_tuner explores the hyperparameter space **synchronously** during
    tuner construction: ``BaseTuner.__init__`` → ``_populate_initial_space``
    → ``_activate_all_conditions`` calls ``self.hypermodel.build(hp)`` (and
    relies on the ``hp.Float(...)`` / ``hp.Choice(...)`` calls inside it to
    register the search space, including any conditional scopes). A synalinks
    ``build_program`` is typically ``async def``, so calling it synchronously
    just returns a coroutine that is never awaited: its body never runs.

    The visible symptom is ``RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'build_program' was
    never awaited`` (raised from ``base_tuner.py`` at construction); the
    latent bug is that the initial search space is left empty and conditional
    hyperparameters are never discovered. (Random/Grid search happen to
    survive an empty initial space by populating it lazily on the first
    trial, but that masks the conditional-HP loss.)

    Driving the coroutine to completion here fixes both. ``run_maybe_nested``
    is safe whether or not an event loop is already running, so this also
    works inside notebooks and async test harnesses. The same wrapper is used
    for the per-trial build in ``_run_trial_async`` (via ``tuner.hypermodel``),

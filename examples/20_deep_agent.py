# Deep Agent

A **Deep Agent** is a coding-style agent that treats a working directory
as its environment: read files, grep them, write or patch them, run a
bit of Python to check the result. Where a `FunctionCallingAgent`
typically calls a few narrow tools (search, calculate, fetch), a deep
agent edits a workspace in place.

In Synalinks the deep agent's tools **are** the methods of a
`MontySandbox` mounted on the workdir. That makes it host-safe by
construction: reads fall through to the real directory, but writes,
edits and code execution are captured in an in-memory copy-on-write
overlay that never modifies the disk.

## What Deep Agents Can Do

    A[User Task] --> B[DeepAgent]
    B --> C{Pick Tool}
    C -->|Discover| D[list_files]
    C -->|Find/grep| E[search_files]
    C -->|Read code| F[read_file]
    C -->|Patch| G[edit_file]

    D --> B
    E --> B
    F --> B
    G --> B
    H --> B
    I --> B
    B --> J[Final Answer]
```

Typical use cases:

1. **Code review / explanation**: read a repo, summarize what each
   file does.
2. **Bug fix loop**: find the failing code, read the relevant module,
   patch it, iterate.
3. **Project bootstrapping**: scaffold a small project in the overlay,
   then persist the result yourself if you're happy with it.
4. **Data wrangling**: search a directory of CSVs / logs, extract
   what's relevant, write a report into the overlay.

## The Seven Built-in Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_files` | List files matching a glob (e.g. `**/*.py`). |
| `search_files` | Glob for files and grep their contents (regex). |
| `read_file` | Read a file by 1-based line range (paginated). |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file (in the overlay). |
| `edit_file` | Exact-string replacement; rejects 0 or 2+ occurrences (pass `replace_all=True` to override). |
| `run_python_code` | Run an inline Python snippet (arg: `code`). |
| `run_python_file` | Run a self-contained script you wrote into the overlay (arg: `path`). |

## Host Safety

Every tool is backed by the sandbox's copy-on-write overlay, so the
agent **cannot damage the real workspace**:

- **Reads** fall through to the real `workdir`.
- **Writes / edits** land in an in-memory overlay; the files on disk
  are never modified. Inspect what changed via
  `agent.sandbox.changes()` / `agent.sandbox.journal()`, and persist
  any of it yourself if you want it on disk.
- **Paths** are rooted at the workdir; `..` cannot escape it, and a
  symlink in the base pointing outside it is refused.
- **`run_python_code`** (inline snippet) and **`run_python_file`** (a
  script the agent wrote into the overlay) both run inside Monty, a
  restricted Python interpreter with a small stdlib subset, no
  third-party imports and no network, so model-authored code can't
  reach the host either. (A `run_python_file` script must be
  self-contained: Monty cannot import other overlay files.)

## Building the Agent

`DeepAgent` mirrors `FunctionCallingAgent`: every parameter on that
class is accepted with identical semantics. The only additions are
`workdir` (required) and the sandbox `timeout` (the per-snippet budget
for `run_python_code` / `run_python_file`).

```python
import synalinks

agent = synalinks.DeepAgent(
    workdir="/tmp/my_project",
    language_model=lm,
    timeout=30,         # per-run_python_code budget, seconds
    max_iterations=10,  # coding tasks tend to need more rounds than RAG/SQL
)
```

There is no "read-only" switch to set: the copy-on-write overlay
already guarantees the real workdir is never modified, so even an agent
that writes, edits, and runs code leaves your files on disk untouched.
Review what it *would* have changed with `agent.sandbox.changes()`.

User-supplied extra tools (e.g. a date helper, a web search) are
passed via `tools=` and merged with the built-ins. The same name-
collision and leading-underscore rules apply as for every other
FunctionCallingAgent-derived class.

## Example Usage

This example creates a small Python project, asks the agent to add a
function, and then inspects the agent's overlay to see the edit, while
the file on disk stays untouched.

```python
result = await agent(ChatMessages(messages=[
    ChatMessage(
        role="user",
        content=(
            "Open calculator.py and add a `multiply(a, b)` function "
            "next to `add`, then read it back to confirm."
        ),
    )
]))
```

The agent will typically:

1. `list_files("**/*")` to see what's in the workdir.
2. `read_file("/calculator.py")` to read existing code.
3. `edit_file(...)` to insert the new function (or `write_file` for a
   full rewrite if the file is short).
4. `read_file(...)` again to confirm, then stop and answer.

## Key Takeaways

- **One module, seven tools**: `synalinks.DeepAgent` bundles file IO,
  search, and a Python sandbox into a single ready-to-use agent.
- **Host-safe by construction**: the tools are a copy-on-write overlay,
  so the agent can explore and edit freely without touching the disk:
  there are no capability gates to set, because nothing it does is ever
  written back.
- **Inspect & persist**: `agent.sandbox.changes()` / `.journal()` /
  `.read_overlay(path)` show exactly what the agent did; you decide what
  (if anything) to write to disk.
- **Token-aware**: `read_file` / `list_files` / `search_files` paginate
  with `offset` / `limit` (1-based, grep convention).

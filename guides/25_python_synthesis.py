# Program Synthesis

Every guide since [Guide 12](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Trainable%20Variables/) optimized the same kind of
trainable state: **prose**. An `instruction` string the LM reads on
every call, and a list of few-shot `examples` it imitates. The
optimizer's job was to write better English.

This guide swaps the genome. The trainable variable is now a **Python
program**, and the optimizer's job is to **write better code**. The
module is `PythonSynthesis`, and the only optimizer that can drive it
is an evolutionary one: `OMEGA`.

The mental shift is worth stating plainly up front. With a `Generator`,
the LM is *in the loop at inference time*: every prediction is an LM
call. With `PythonSynthesis`, the LM is *only in the training loop*. At
inference time there is **no LM**, just a deterministic Python script
running in a sandbox. The LM's role is to author and refine that script
during `fit`, not to run it. This is the neuro-symbolic, self-evolving
paradigm that systems like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve popularized: a
language model proposes code, a deterministic evaluator scores it, and
an evolutionary search keeps what works.

## Two Kinds of Trainable State

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Prose["Generator (prose genome)"]
        A1["input"] --> B1["LM call w/ instruction + examples"]
        B1 --> C1["output"]
    end
    subgraph Code["PythonSynthesis (code genome)"]
        A2["input dict"] --> B2["run python_script in sandbox"]
        B2 --> C2["output dict"]
    end
```

Both modules expose a trainable variable and both are optimized by
scoring outputs against a reward. The difference is *what* the variable
holds and *who* runs it:

| | `Generator` | `PythonSynthesis` |
|---|---|---|
| Trainable variable | instruction + examples (text) | a Python script (code) |
| Runs the variable at inference | the LM | the Mirage sandbox |
| LM calls per prediction | one | **zero** |
| LM calls during training | scoring/optimizing the prompt | authoring/refining the script |
| Output | whatever the LM emits | whatever the script assigns to `result` |

## What `PythonSynthesis` Does

A `PythonSynthesis` module is a pure data transform: it takes the input
JSON object, runs the current script, and returns the output JSON
object. The contract the script must honor:

- The input is exposed as a dict named `inputs`.
- The script must assign its answer to a variable named `result`
  before it ends.
- `result` must validate against the module's target schema (the
  `data_model` you pass in). If it does not, the run is discarded.

The script runs inside the **Mirage** sandbox: a real, isolated
Python 3 interpreter, sandboxed from the host. Because it is genuine
CPython, the optimizer can write ordinary Python:

- The **full standard library** is importable, along with any
  third-party package installed in the environment (`numpy`, `pandas`,
  …), and `class` definitions and `match` statements are supported.
- Tools bound to the module are exposed as **global async callables**
  under their tool name: `await` them inside an `async def` driven by
  `asyncio.run(...)`; each call returns a dict.
- The sandbox is host-safe, the script runs isolated from the real
  workspace, and execution is bounded by the module's `timeout`
  (long-running scripts are aborted). The exact constraints ultimately
  depend on the active sandbox (`sandbox.description`).

Because LM-authored code fails *often*, a syntax slip, a forbidden
import, an infinite loop, an output of the wrong shape, the module is
built to **fail soft**. On any error it returns your
`default_return_value` (which must itself validate against the schema)
and surfaces the interpreter's `stdout`/`stderr` on the output, so the
optimizer can read the traceback and fix the bug on the next
generation. A script that loops forever is killed at `timeout` and
treated the same way.

```python
import synalinks

synthesis = synalinks.PythonSynthesis(
    data_model=OutputModel,                  # the schema `result` must match
    python_script=SEED_SCRIPT,               # the starting script (the seed)
    default_return_value={"output_grid": [[0]]},  # used when a run fails
)
```

## Why It Needs `OMEGA` (and not `RandomFewShot`)

`RandomFewShot` ([Guide 15](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Training/)) optimizes a `Generator` by collecting
high-reward `(input, output)` pairs and pasting them into the prompt as
demonstrations. It has no machinery to *write code*; it only curates
examples. Point it at a `PythonSynthesis` module and it has nothing to
do; the script never changes.

`OMEGA` is an **evolutionary** optimizer ([Guide 15](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Training/)
introduced it briefly). It treats the script as a **genome** and runs a genetic
algorithm over a population of script variants:

- **Mutation.** An LM is shown the current script, the inputs, what it
  predicted, the ground truth, and the reward, and asked to rewrite the
  script to do better. This is where the bug-fixing and rule-discovery
  happens.
- **Crossover.** Two high-performing scripts are merged by an LM into a
  new one that combines their strengths.
- **Dominated Novelty Search (DNS).** OMEGA's signature step: a
  candidate is dropped only if it is *both* lower-reward *and* similar
  to a fitter neighbor (similarity measured by embedding the candidate
  with an `embedding_model`). This keeps the population diverse, so the
  search does not collapse onto one mediocre approach, which is exactly
  the failure mode you want to avoid when synthesizing algorithms.

That last point is why `OMEGA` needs **both** a `language_model` (to
write the code) **and** an `embedding_model` (to measure novelty):

```python
optimizer = synalinks.optimizers.OMEGA(
    language_model=code_model,        # writes/refines the scripts
    embedding_model=embedding_model,  # measures candidate novelty (DNS)
    population_size=8,                # how many scripts to keep alive
)
```

## The Evolutionary Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Seed script"] --> POP["Population of scripts"]
    POP --> RUN["Run each in the Mirage sandbox over the batch"]
    RUN --> REW["ExactMatch reward on the output"]
    REW --> MUT["OMEGA: LM mutates / crosses over the survivors"]
    MUT --> DNS["DNS: drop candidates that are dominated AND similar"]
    DNS --> POP
    REW --> STOP{"reward == 1.0?"}
    STOP -->|"yes"| KEEP["Keep the winning script"]
```

The seed is just a starting point, usually a trivial identity
function. The optimizer earns its keep by turning that seed into a real
algorithm across generations.

## The Task: ARC-AGI

ARC-AGI (the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) is a benchmark of small
visual puzzles. Each task gives you a handful of `(input_grid,
output_grid)` example pairs that demonstrate a hidden transformation
rule, then a fresh `input_grid` you must transform by the same rule. A
grid is a list of integer rows, each integer a color `0`–`9`.

ARC-AGI is a natural fit for program synthesis for three reasons:

1. **The rules are algorithmic.** "Tile the grid into a 3×3 of itself
   wherever a cell is non-zero", "recolor the largest shape", "reflect
   across the diagonal"; these are short programs, not facts to
   memorize. A Python script can express them exactly; a prompt can
   only gesture at them.
2. **Scoring is exact and cheap.** A predicted grid either equals the
   true grid or it does not. `ExactMatch` gives a crisp `0`/`1` reward
   with no LM-as-judge cost.
3. **It is genuinely hard, but tractable for a strong model.** This
   particular task (`007bbfb7`) is one a capable code model can crack:
   in practice `gemini/gemini-3.5-flash` solved it in the first
   generation (see the evolved script below). Treat that as the
   optimistic case, not the rule; most ARC tasks are far harder, and a
   weak or local model will mostly demonstrate the wiring rather than
   land a solution.

Synalinks ships ARC-AGI as a built-in dataset. `load_data` returns the
familiar `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)` NumPy-array shape, and
provides ready-made input/output `DataModel`s so you do not hand-write
the schema:

```python
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = synalinks.datasets.arcagi.load_data(
    task_name="007bbfb7",
    arc_version=1,
)
input_model = synalinks.datasets.arcagi.get_input_data_model()   # examples + input_grid
output_model = synalinks.datasets.arcagi.get_output_data_model()  # output_grid
```

## Wiring It Together

```python
inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=input_model)   # examples + input_grid
synthesis = synalinks.PythonSynthesis(
    data_model=output_model,                        # result must match this
    python_script=SEED_SCRIPT,
    default_return_value={"output_grid": [[0]]},
)
outputs = await synthesis(inputs)
program = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

reward = synalinks.rewards.ExactMatch(in_mask=["output_grid"])
program.compile(
    reward=reward,
    optimizer=synalinks.optimizers.OMEGA(
        language_model=code_model,
        embedding_model=embedding_model,
        population_size=8,
        instructions=synalinks.datasets.arcagi.default_instructions(),
    ),
    metrics=[synalinks.metrics.MeanMetricWrapper(fn=reward, name="mean_reward")],
)
history = await program.fit(
    x=x_train,
    y=y_train,
    epochs=20,  # a cap; EarlyStopping ends the run as soon as it solves
    validation_split=0.2,
    callbacks=[
        synalinks.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
            monitor="reward", mode="max", patience=2, restore_best_variables=True
        ),
    ],
)
```

Note the reward's `in_mask=["output_grid"]`: the module's output also
carries `stdout`/`stderr` fields, and we score *only* the grid.

The `EarlyStopping` callback matters more here than in prose tuning.
`ExactMatch` is a `0`/`1` reward, so it jumps straight to its `1.0`
ceiling the instant a script solves the training set, often in the
first generation with a capable code model. Set a generous `epochs`
cap and let `EarlyStopping(mode="max")` halt the run once the reward
stops improving; `restore_best_variables=True` keeps the solving
script. Without it you keep paying for LM mutation calls that
re-evolve an already-perfect solution.

## The Payoff: Interpretable State

After training, the learned state is not an inscrutable tensor; it is a
**Python script you can read**. Pull it off the module's variable:

```python
best = sorted(
    synthesis.state.get("best_candidates") or [],
    key=lambda c: c.get("reward", 0),
    reverse=True,
)
print(best[0]["python_script"])  # the highest-scoring evolved algorithm
```

This is the same property the [Training guide](https://synalinks.github.io/synalinks/guides/Training/) emphasized for prompts,
taken to its conclusion: the artifact of training is source code. You
can read it, audit it, copy it into a regular module, and run it forever
with zero LM calls.

Here is a script OMEGA actually evolved for this task, driving the loop
with `gemini/gemini-3.5-flash`. It reached reward `1.0` in the **first
generation** and solved all 5 training examples *and* the held-out test
input: a correct, general fractal self-tiling algorithm:

```python
def transform(inputs):
    input_grid = inputs.get("input_grid")
    n = len(input_grid)
    m = len(input_grid[0])

    # Create the output grid (n*3 x m*3) initialized to 0
    output_grid = [[0] * (m * 3) for _ in range(n * 3)]

    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(m):
            if input_grid[r][c] != 0:
                # Stamp a copy of the whole input into block (r, c)
                for br in range(n):
                    for bc in range(m):
                        output_grid[r * 3 + br][c * 3 + bc] = input_grid[br][bc]

    return {"output_grid": output_grid}

result = transform(inputs)
```

Read that against the seed (an identity that just echoes the input):
the optimizer discovered the rule, "tile the grid into a 3×3 of itself,
placing a copy wherever the input cell is non-zero", purely from the
reward signal and the example pairs in the mutation prompt.

## Honest Expectations and Failure Modes

- **ARC is hard; the seed will score 0.** The identity seed echoes its
  input, so unless the task *is* the identity, the first reward is `0`.
  Improvement shows up across generations, and only if the code model is
  strong enough to discover the rule. A small local model will mostly
  produce sandbox errors; reach for a capable **code** model for real
  attempts.
- **`ExactMatch` is unforgiving.** One wrong cell drops the reward to
  `0`. There is no partial credit. This is correct for ARC but means the
  reward signal is sparse; large populations and more generations help.
- **The sandbox rejects a lot.** Scripts that import `numpy`, define a
  `class`, or use `itertools` will fail and fall back to the default.
  Read `stderr` on the predictions to see why; that feedback is exactly
  what OMEGA's mutation step consumes.
- **Cost scales with `population_size × generations × batch`.** Each
  candidate is an LM authoring call. Start small while you debug the
  wiring, then scale up.

## Best Practices, Distilled

1. **Make the seed runnable, not clever.** A trivial identity script
   that returns a schema-valid `result` gives the optimizer a working
   scaffold to mutate. A broken seed wastes the first generations on
   syntax repair.
2. **Pick a strong code model for the LM.** This optimizer writes
   programs; the bottleneck is the model's coding ability, not its prose.
3. **Keep `default_return_value` schema-valid and minimal.** It is the
   floor every failed run lands on; `{"output_grid": [[0]]}` is enough.
4. **Read `stderr`.** When rewards stay at `0`, the predictions'
   `stderr` tells you whether the model is hitting a sandbox wall versus
   getting the algorithm wrong.
5. **Stop early.** Pair a generous `epochs` cap with
   `EarlyStopping(monitor="reward", mode="max", restore_best_variables=True)`.
   Because `ExactMatch` saturates at `1.0`, a capable model often solves
   in the first generation; without early stopping you pay for every
   remaining epoch re-evolving a solution you already have.
6. **Save after every run.** `program.save("path.json")` writes the
   evolved script to a human-readable file; `diff` it across runs to
   watch the algorithm take shape.

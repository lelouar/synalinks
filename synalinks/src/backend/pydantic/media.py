"""Multimodal content types.

A modality is just a *content part* of a `Message`: the OpenAI/litellm
chat-completion `content` is either a string or a list of parts, and an image
or an audio clip is one of those parts. So multimodal input is plain
chat-completion: `Image` and `Audio` are special types you drop straight into
a `ChatMessage`'s content list, mixed with the text that usually goes with
them:

```python
synalinks.ChatMessage(
    role="user",
    content=[
        "What is in this picture? Answer in one sentence.",
        synalinks.Image(url="https://example.com/cat.png"),
    ],
)
```

`ChatMessage` normalizes each element to its wire part (a plain `str` becomes a
`text` part, an `Image`/`Audio` becomes its own part), so the message stays a
strict chat-completion message and flows through the normal generator path.

## Two ways a source becomes a payload

A `url` or `path` is just a *reference*; at some point the actual bytes have to
be read and inlined as a base64 ``data:`` URI so every provider, including
local ones that cannot fetch a URL themselves, receives the same self-contained
payload. There are two moments that can happen, for two different use cases:

1. **At construction**, when you build an `Image(url=...)` / `Audio(path=...)`
   in Python. The bytes are fetched/read immediately, so an unreachable source
   fails loudly right where it is written and the object is reusable without
   re-fetching. This is the right default for hand-written, interactive use.

2. **Per batch, at inference**, for content built from raw JSON rather than the
   Python constructor: most importantly `Dataset` rows, which go through
   `ChatMessages.model_validate_json(...)`. There the `image_url`/`input_audio`
   parts stay as lightweight **references** (a `url`/`path`), so a dataset of a
   million images never inlines a million payloads into memory. Resolution is
   deferred to `resolve_content_media`, which the language model calls on the
   messages it is about to send; i.e. only the current batch's media is ever
   resolved at once, and it is freed as soon as the request goes out.

A payload already inline (base64 `data`, or a ``data:`` URI) is left untouched
by both paths, so the per-batch resolver is a no-op on construction-resolved
content.

Adding a modality (video, documents, ...) is a new `DataModel` here with a
`to_content_part()` method; nothing else in the stack needs to change.

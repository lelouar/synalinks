    """A code-execution sandbox backed by `Mirage <https://mirage.strukto.ai>`_.

    !!! warning "Experimental"
        The sandbox API is experimental and may change in a future
        release.

    Wraps a Mirage ``Workspace``: a virtual filesystem that mounts resources
    (RAM, disk, S3, Postgres, SSH, ...) under virtual paths and runs shell
    commands against them. ``run_code`` executes Python through Mirage's ``python3``
    builtin, and the file tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, ...) operate
    on the mounted virtual filesystem.

    Example:

    ```python
    import synalinks

    sandbox = synalinks.MirageSandbox(timeout=10)
    await sandbox.run_code("x = 6 * 7")
    result = await sandbox.run_code("print(x)")
    print(result.stdout)                    # -> "42\\n"

    # Snapshot + restore (workspace + interpreter state)
    blob = sandbox.dump()
    restored = synalinks.MirageSandbox.load(blob)
    ```

    ## Python state persistence

    Mirage spawns a **fresh** ``python3`` process per command, so Python
    variables would not normally survive between ``run_code`` calls. The sandbox
    bridges this by serializing the interpreter namespace (variables, imports,
    user-defined functions and classes) with ``dill`` after each snippet and
    restoring it before the next. State therefore persists across ``run_code`` calls
    just like a REPL (without replaying earlier snippets), and a snippet that
    raises does not wipe the accumulated namespace.

    ## Confinement (the default; `confine=True`, Linux and macOS)

    By default each ``run_code`` (and any ``python3`` spawned by `run_bash`) is
    **confined**: it enters a fresh user / mount / PID / network namespace and
    ``pivot_root``s into the FUSE-mounted virtual filesystem, so the snippet
    sees **only** the virtual sandbox at ``/`` (and, via the PID namespace, only
    its own processes in ``/proc``: no host PIDs). Its own ``open(...)`` /
    ``pathlib`` land on the mount (one filesystem, shared with the file tools),
    the host filesystem is hidden, and the network is cut. A seccomp denylist
    (``seccomp=True``) shrinks the reachable kernel syscall surface, and the
    runtime is bind-mounted **read-only** (venv / stdlib / system lib/bin, so
    confined code cannot poison files the host later imports). It is rootless
    and entirely in-process (no container runtime): the Python subprocess
    sandboxes itself at startup via ``unshare`` + read-only runtime binds +
    ``pivot_root``, with optional ``RLIMIT_*`` caps. Requires Linux,
    ``/dev/fuse``, libfuse and unprivileged user namespaces.

    **Secure by default, and fail-closed**: the sandbox always uses the
    strongest backend the host can run (there is no knob to pick a weaker
    one; `granted_capabilities` reports which, as ``backend``), and where none
    can run it **raises** rather than run code unconfined. Weakening is always
    explicit: ``confine=False`` opts out, and ``require_confinement=False``
    restores a warn-and-run-unconfined fallback.

    ## Confinement on macOS (a Linux microVM, Seatbelt as the floor)

    On Apple silicon with libkrun installed, each ``python3`` runs in a fresh
    **Linux microVM** (libkrun on Hypervisor.framework, ~0.3 s per run), and
    the Linux confinement above runs *inside* it, unchanged: namespaces, PID
    isolation, seccomp, read-only runtime, cut network, behind a guest kernel
    of its own. The guest serves the virtual filesystem itself (a FUSE mount
    bridged over vsock to this workspace, so macFUSE is not needed), sees no
    host files but this sandbox's own state dir, and inherits no host
    environment variables. The helper process that runs the VM confines
    *itself* with a Seatbelt profile first, so escaping the VM through the
    hypervisor layer still lands in a sandbox. ``backend`` is ``"microvm"``.
    ``extra_binds`` are shared into the VM read-only, except under directories
    the Linux image owns (``/usr``, ``/opt``, ...); host packages that are
    compiled macOS binaries cannot run in the Linux guest.

    Where no microVM can run (Intel Macs, a Mac that is itself a VM, libkrun
    missing), macOS confines through **Seatbelt**, the TrustedBSD MAC policy behind the
    App Sandbox, because none of the Linux mechanism exists on XNU: namespaces,
    ``pivot_root`` and seccomp are Linux kernel features. ``sandbox_init``
    applies a default-deny SBPL profile to the process, which **enforces the
    filesystem and network boundaries plus ``RLIMIT_*``**: the snippet reads
    only the Python runtime it needs, writes only the sandbox's own directories
    and the macFUSE-mounted virtual filesystem, and gets no network unless
    ``confine_network=True`` (the host-tool bridge socket stays reachable either
    way). Reads are restricted, not merely writes. The process stands in the
    mount, so a *relative* ``open()`` lands on the virtual filesystem the file
    tools see; an absolute path names the host, where the profile denies it.

    Where macOS allows it the profile grants *less* than the Linux path:

    * **Mach services by name, three of them.** A bare ``(allow mach-lookup)``
      is the real escape route, since a daemon does the work outside the
      caller's profile. The three allowed are what libSystem looks up while a
      freshly exec'd child starts; none brokers process execution.
    * **write xor execute.** The writable area denies ``file-map-executable``,
      so a snippet cannot ``dlopen`` a dylib it wrote itself.
    * **no reach into ``workdir``.** It is a seed, copied in host-side, and
      stays unreadable and unwritable from inside.

    Subprocesses work as on Linux: exec is limited to the read-only runtime set
    (so not a binary the snippet wrote), and a child **inherits the profile**.

    Guarantees from the Linux path that remain **weaker** (``backend`` in
    `granted_capabilities` reports ``"seatbelt"`` so code can tell):

    * **no PID namespace** - XNU has none. The host process table is hidden
      (``process-info`` and the ``kern.proc`` sysctls are denied) and signals
      reach only the snippet's own process tree, but PIDs are shared.
    * **no syscall filter** - Seatbelt gates MAC operations, not syscall
      numbers, so the seccomp denylist has no counterpart, and the snippet
      shares the host kernel.
    * **fork budget, not a count** - ``RLIMIT_NPROC`` is per *user*, so the cap
      is set to the user's running processes plus ``max_processes``.

    ## Windows (run under WSL2)

    Windows has no confinement backend: ``unshare`` / ``pivot_root`` / FUSE /
    seccomp have no native-Windows equivalent, and Seatbelt is macOS-only. The
    supported way to get it on
    Windows is to run synalinks **inside WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2):
    it is a real Linux kernel, so confinement works unchanged, and because WSL2
    is itself a lightweight VM, the confined process is additionally separated
    from the Windows host by the VM boundary. On **native** Windows
    confinement is unavailable, so a default ``MirageSandbox()`` raises (with a
    pointer to WSL2) rather than run an LM's code unconfined. (WSL1 also cannot
    confine: it has no ``/dev/fuse``; use WSL2.)

    ## Unconfined (`confine=False`)

    With ``confine=False`` the snippet runs in a **real, unrestricted CPython
    subprocess** with network access, and two distinct filesystems are in play:

    - The interpreter's own OS file I/O (``open(...)``, ``pathlib``) hits the
      **host** filesystem the Python process runs on.
    - The Mirage **virtual** filesystem (the mounted resources) is reached
      through the shell and the sandbox's file tools (`read_file`,
      `write_file`, `list_files`, `search_files`, `edit_file`,
      `run_python_file`), where mounted S3 buckets, disks, etc. live.

    They are separate spaces, so use the file tools / shell for the mounts and
    ``run_code`` for computation. Choose this only for trusted code that must reach
    the host filesystem or network.

    ## Bound tools and mounts are the real boundary

    Confinement hides the host and cuts the network, but **bound functions and
    mounted resources are capabilities you hand in**: a prompt-injected model
    will use whatever you expose. Bind only the tools the task needs, mount only
    what it needs (read-only where possible), prefer ``allowed_hosts`` over
    ``confine_network`` for egress, and call `granted_capabilities` to audit
    the exact surface before trusting a sandbox with untrusted code.

    ## Bound functions

    Host callables (the ``external_functions`` constructor arg /
    `bind_functions`) are exposed inside the sandbox as **plain synchronous**
    global functions: call them directly, ``result = tool_name(...)``. Because
    Mirage runs the snippet in a separate subprocess, each call is bridged over
    a host Unix socket: the in-sandbox stub RPCs to the host (driving the
    bridge on a background event-loop thread), which runs the real (possibly
    LM-calling) tool and
    returns its JSON-marshalable result synchronously.

    Args:
        timeout (float): Per-snippet execution budget in seconds, what
            ``run_code(timeout=None)`` uses (Default 300, as on E2B). Enforced
            around the underlying Mirage command; on expiry ``run_code``
            raises `TimeoutException`, as on E2B.
        name (str): Optional. Human-readable name for the sandbox.
        workdir (str): Optional. Host directory whose files seed the virtual
            filesystem at construction. The files are copied **into** the mount
            (host-safe: the agent's writes/edits never touch the real
            directory). ``None`` for an empty scratch filesystem.
        resources (dict): Optional. Mapping of virtual mount prefix → Mirage
            resource (e.g. ``{"/": RAMResource()}``), or → a ``(resource,
            MountMode)`` tuple to set that mount's access mode explicitly.
            Defaults to a single in-memory ``RAMResource`` mounted at ``/``.
            **Least-privilege default:** the root scratch mount is ``EXEC``
            (writable, runs ``python3``), but any *other* bare mount defaults to
            ``READ`` (read-only) so an external resource (S3, Postgres, disk) you
            mount cannot be written/corrupted by sandboxed code unless you opt in
            with a ``(resource, MountMode.WRITE)`` / ``EXEC`` tuple.
        mode (MountMode): Optional. Overrides the default mount mode for **all**
            bare resources (i.e. opts out of the per-mount least-privilege rule
            above). ``None`` (default) applies the rule; pass e.g.
            ``MountMode.EXEC`` to make every bare mount read/write/exec.
        session_id (str): Optional. Mirage session whose working directory and
            environment persist across commands. Defaults to ``"default"``.
        confine (bool): Optional. When ``True`` (Linux; macOS via Seatbelt, see
            above), each ``run_code`` executes the snippet in a fresh user /
            mount / network namespace pivoted into the FUSE-mounted virtual
            filesystem: the snippet sees **only** the virtual sandbox at ``/``
            (its ``open()`` lands on the mount, unifying it with the file
            tools), the host filesystem is hidden, and the network is cut.
            Rootless, in-process: no container runtime. Requires ``/dev/fuse``
            and unprivileged user namespaces (on macOS: macFUSE and
            libsandbox); on an unsupported host it is disabled with a
            ``RuntimeWarning`` (graceful fallback). **Defaults to ``True``**
            (secure by default): a plain ``MirageSandbox()`` is confined +
            syscall-filtered + network-cut, and refuses to run where it cannot
            confine. Pass ``confine=False`` to opt out (e.g. when the code must
            reach the host filesystem or network).
        require_confinement (bool): Optional. Confinement **fails closed**.
            When ``True`` (implies ``confine=True``), any condition that would
            otherwise silently fall back to *unconfined* execution (confinement
            unavailable on the host, the FUSE mount failing to come up, or a
            ``fork(confine=True)`` that cannot confine) raises instead of
            warning, and a `run_code` / `run_bash` whose confinement is not active is
            refused. Use this for untrusted (e.g. LM-generated) code, where a
            missing isolation boundary must be a hard error rather than a warning
            that scrolls past. Defaults to ``None``: follows ``confine``, so a
            confined sandbox fails closed. ``False`` restores the graceful
            fallback (warn, then run unconfined).
        seccomp (bool): Optional. Apply a seccomp syscall denylist inside a
            confined run, shrinking the kernel attack surface (no eBPF, ptrace,
            userfaultfd, perf, keyrings, module loading, kexec, namespace ops,
            ``open_by_handle_at``, ...; denied calls return ``EPERM``). Active
            only when confined and on a supported arch (x86_64 / aarch64);
            elsewhere it is a no-op. Defaults to ``True``.
        confine_network (bool): Optional. Keep **full** network access inside a
            confined run (skip the network namespace). All-or-nothing and not
            filtered; prefer ``allowed_hosts`` for restricted egress. Defaults
            to ``False`` (no network).
        allowed_hosts (list): Optional. Egress allowlist. When set, a host-
            mediated ``http_fetch`` tool is bound that reaches only these hosts
            (exact, or ``*.example.com`` for subdomains + apex; redirects are
            re-checked). Under confinement the network is cut, so this tool is
            the *only* egress path and the model cannot open raw sockets around
            it (enforced host-side). Without ``confine=True`` it is advisory
            (raw sockets still work) and a ``RuntimeWarning`` is emitted.
            ``None`` (default) binds no egress tool.
        block_private_egress (bool): Optional. When ``True`` (default), the
            ``http_fetch`` egress tool additionally refuses hosts that resolve
            to non-public addresses (loopback, private RFC 1918, link-local
            including the ``169.254.169.254`` cloud-metadata IP, reserved or
            multicast), re-checked on each redirect, and **pins the connection
            to the validated IP** so a host cannot re-resolve to an internal
            address after the check (no DNS-rebinding window; TLS still verifies
            the cert against the hostname). An SSRF guard so an allowlisted name
            pointing inward (CNAME / poisoned DNS) is refused. Set ``False`` to
            allow reaching internal targets. No effect without ``allowed_hosts``.
        memory_limit_mb (int): Optional. Address-space cap (``RLIMIT_AS``) for a
            confined run, in MiB. ``None`` for no limit.
        cpu_limit_seconds (int): Optional. CPU-time cap (``RLIMIT_CPU``) for a
            confined run, in seconds. ``None`` for no limit.
        malloc_arena_max (int): Optional. Cap on the host process's glibc
            malloc arenas, applied once per process when the first sandbox is
            built (``M_ARENA_MAX``; see ``cap_malloc_arenas``). Without it a
            long-lived host retains a 64 MiB arena per worker thread that ever
            allocated, gigabytes after hours of snippets. ``None`` leaves the
            allocator alone. Defaults to ``2``.
        max_processes (int): Optional. Process cap (``RLIMIT_NPROC``) for a
            confined run (fork-bomb guard). Defaults to 64; ``None`` to disable.
            ``RLIMIT_NPROC`` is counted per user, which on Linux
            means the fresh user namespace the sandbox unshares, so the cap
            applies to the sandbox alone (in the macOS microVM too). Under
            Seatbelt, with no namespace to scope it to, the cap is set to the
            user's running processes plus this budget.
        extra_binds (list): Optional. Additional host directories to bind
            **read-only** into the confined root, on top of the auto-detected
            Python install / site-packages / ``PYTHONPATH`` dirs (which already
            make host-installed libraries importable). Use for libraries in
            nonstandard locations, data files or model weights. A bound dir is
            *visible* in the sandbox at its original path; to ``import`` from it
            it must also be on ``sys.path`` (set ``PYTHONPATH`` or
            ``sys.path.insert(...)`` in the snippet). No effect when unconfined
            (there the whole host filesystem is already visible). Read-only.
        workspace_kwargs (dict): Optional. Extra keyword arguments forwarded to
            the Mirage ``Workspace`` constructor (e.g. ``consistency``,
            ``cache_limit``, ``runtimes``). Under confinement the ``runtimes``
            list is restricted to known-sandboxed engines
            (``monty``, ``quickjs``, ``vfs``, ``wasi``); any other entry (such
            as ``local``, which runs code on the **host** interpreter and so
            bypasses confinement) is rejected under ``require_confinement`` and
            stripped with a warning whenever ``confine`` is active. Mirage's
            default runtime world is already sandboxed, so leaving ``runtimes``
            unset needs no such handling.
        external_functions (dict): Optional. ``name -> callable`` mapping bound
            persistently and exposed inside the sandbox on every run (see
            above).

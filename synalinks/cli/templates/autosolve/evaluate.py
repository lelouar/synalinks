"""The Synalinks program *and* its evaluation harness, in one file.

This is **autosolve**: a self-improving system where *you, the coding
agent, are the optimizer*. There is **no training loop** here: no
``program.fit()``, no in-context optimizer, no few-shot search. Instead you read
the program's actual failures and **rewrite the program itself** (its
instructions, field descriptions, module composition, or whole new modules),
then re-run this file to measure whether the reward went up. The optimization
loop is your own reasoning; this script is just the measuring instrument.

    uv run python evaluate.py            # iterate: score the DEV set, dump failures
    uv run python evaluate.py --test     # confirm: also score the held-out TEST set

The only flag is ``--test``, and it is a *mode gate*, not a lever: by default the
held-out test set is never touched, so you cannot tune toward it while you
iterate. Run ``--test`` only to confirm a result you already like on
``dev_reward``.

What it does, in order:
  1. turn on Synalinks logging so every module call is observable (see
     ``LOG_LEVEL``); the run prints each module's inputs/outputs to stdout,
  2. load a GSM8K subset (small by default so it runs locally: even ONE sample
     is a valid loop; see ``DEV_SIZE``),
  3. build the program (see ``build_program`` below), the thing you edit,
  4. run it over the DEV set with ``predict()`` and score every example with the
     reward, writing per-example results to ``predictions_dev.jsonl`` (READ
     THESE; they are how you find the next thing to fix),
  5. (only with --test) score the held-out TEST subset,
  6. print a RESULTS block and append one row to ``results.tsv``.

The autosolve loop runs this as ``uv run python evaluate.py > eval.log 2>&1``,
so ``eval.log`` holds the full module-by-module trace. To understand *why* a
prediction is wrong, read it; pair it with ``DEV_SIZE = 1`` to study a single
problem in full detail.

Every *lever* is code in this file, not a CLI flag. That is deliberate: each
experiment is fully captured by the diff and reproducible from the code alone
(`git reset --hard` undoes one). See ``AUTOSOLVE.md`` for the loop around it.

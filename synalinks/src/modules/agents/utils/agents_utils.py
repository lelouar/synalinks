"""Shared helpers for the code agents (FunctionCalling, RLM, Deep Agent).

Covers workdir resolution, AGENTS.md (the agents.md standard) discovery +
injection, tool merging, and the metadata-only input summary the agents show the
LM: field previews and sizes, never the full values. The full payload is made
reachable to the agent's code another way: bound as the ``inputs`` REPL variable
(RLM), or written as a JSON file in the sandbox's copy-on-write overlay (Deep
Agent); the summary's ``inputs_file`` field names that file when the file route
is used. Agent Skills helpers live in ``skills_utils``.

# helpers (structured like the Agent Skills ones in ``skills_utils``) discover
# the root + nested files; the prompt renderer emits the root file's content
# verbatim. The spec does not prescribe any prompt wording, so no framing is

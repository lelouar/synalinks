# Observability with MLflow

Synalinks provides built-in observability through MLflow, enabling you to trace and monitor your LM programs in production.

## Overview

The observability system automatically creates spans for each module call, capturing:

- **Inputs and outputs** of each module; language model and decision model spans
  carry the chat messages and tools in OpenAI format, so the MLflow UI renders the
  conversation
- **Token usage and cost** on language model and decision model spans, using
  MLflow's standard `mlflow.chat.tokenUsage`, `mlflow.llm.cost`, `mlflow.llm.model`
  and `mlflow.llm.provider` attributes, so the trace-level token and cost roll-ups
  work
- **Duration** and **success/failure status** of each call, including the model
  calls that failed every retry (they return `None` instead of raising)
- **Parent-child relationships** between nested module calls
- **Phase tags**: every trace is tagged `synalinks.program` and `synalinks.phase`
  (`inference`, `reward` or `optimizer`), so the calls made by rewards and optimizers
  during training can be filtered out of production views
- **Linked prompts**: calls of a module whose prompt was registered in the Prompt
  Registry link the trace to that prompt version

## Quick Start

### Enable Observability

> **Important**: You must call `enable_observability()` **BEFORE** creating any modules.
> Hooks are registered when modules are instantiated, so enabling observability after
> module creation will not trace those modules.

```python
import synalinks

# Enable FIRST, before creating any modules
synalinks.enable_observability(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000", experiment_name="my_experiment"
)

# Now create your modules - they will be automatically traced
inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Question)
outputs = await synalinks.Generator(...)(inputs)
```

Once enabled, all module calls in your program will be automatically traced.

### Example Usage

```python
import asyncio
import synalinks

# Enable observability before creating your program
synalinks.enable_observability(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000", experiment_name="question_answering"
)


class Question(synalinks.DataModel):
    question: str = synalinks.Field(description="The user's question")


class Answer(synalinks.DataModel):
    answer: str = synalinks.Field(description="The answer to the question")


async def main():
    language_model = synalinks.LanguageModel(model="gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview")

    # Create a simple question-answering program
    inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Question)
    outputs = await synalinks.Generator(
        data_model=Answer,
        language_model=language_model,
    )(inputs)

    program = synalinks.Program(
        inputs=inputs,
        outputs=outputs,
        name="qa_program",
        description="A simple QA program",
    )

    # Run the program - traces will be sent to MLflow
    result = await program(Question(question="What is the capital of France?"))
    if result:
        print(result.prettify_json())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Running MLflow with Docker

### Using Docker

Run MLflow tracking server locally with artifact proxying enabled:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name mlflow \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -v mlflow-data:/mlflow \
    ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:latest \
    mlflow server \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 5000 \
    --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow/mlflow.db \
    --default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/ \
    --serve-artifacts \
    --artifacts-destination /mlflow/artifacts
```

**Important flags:**

- `--serve-artifacts`: Enables the MLflow server to proxy artifact uploads from clients
- `--default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/`: Tells clients to use the server as an artifact proxy
- `--artifacts-destination /mlflow/artifacts`: Where the server stores artifacts on disk

Then configure Synalinks to use it:

```python
import synalinks

synalinks.enable_observability(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000", experiment_name="synalinks_traces"
)
```

### Using Docker Compose

For a more complete setup with persistent storage, create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  mlflow:
    image: ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:latest
    container_name: mlflow
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./mlflow-data:/mlflow
    command: >
      mlflow server
      --host 0.0.0.0
      --port 5000
      --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow/mlflow.db
      --default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/
      --serve-artifacts
      --artifacts-destination /mlflow/artifacts
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Access the MLflow UI at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Production Setup with PostgreSQL

For production deployments, use PostgreSQL as the backend store:

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: mlflow-postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: mlflow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mlflow
      POSTGRES_DB: mlflow
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U mlflow"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
    restart: unless-stopped

  mlflow:
    image: ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:latest
    container_name: mlflow
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - mlflow-artifacts:/mlflow/artifacts
    environment:
      MLFLOW_BACKEND_STORE_URI: postgresql://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/mlflow
    command: >
      mlflow server
      --host 0.0.0.0
      --port 5000
      --backend-store-uri postgresql://mlflow:mlflow@postgres:5432/mlflow
      --default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/
      --serve-artifacts
      --artifacts-destination /mlflow/artifacts
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres-data:
  mlflow-artifacts:
```

## Understanding Traces

When you run a Synalinks program with observability enabled, MLflow captures detailed traces.

### Span Types

Synalinks automatically categorizes spans based on module type for better visualization in MLflow:

| Module | Span Type |
|--------|-----------|
| `LanguageModel`, `DecisionModel` | `CHAT_MODEL` |
| `EmbeddingModel` | `EMBEDDING` |
| `FunctionCallingAgent` | `AGENT` |
| `EmbedKnowledge`, `RetrieveKnowledge`, `UpdateKnowledge` | `RETRIEVER` |
| `Tool` | `TOOL` |
| Other modules (`Generator`, `ChainOfThought`, `SelfCritique`...) | `CHAIN` |

A `Generator` is a `CHAIN` span wrapping the `CHAT_MODEL` span of the model it
calls. A `DecisionModel` is called like a `LanguageModel`, so its calls
are traced the same way.

### Span Attributes

Each span includes these attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `synalinks.call_id` | Unique identifier for this call |
| `synalinks.parent_call_id` | ID of the parent call (for nested modules) |
| `synalinks.module` | Module class name (e.g., `Generator`) |
| `synalinks.module_name` | Custom name given to the module |
| `synalinks.module_description` | Module description |
| `synalinks.is_symbolic` | Whether the call was symbolic (graph building) |
| `synalinks.duration` | Call duration in seconds |
| `synalinks.success` | Whether the call succeeded |

Model spans (`CHAT_MODEL`) also carry:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `mlflow.llm.model` / `mlflow.llm.provider` | The model requested (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o-mini`) and its provider |
| `mlflow.chat.tokenUsage` | Input, output and total tokens of the call |
| `mlflow.llm.cost` | Cost of the call in USD (`total_cost`), when known |
| `synalinks.cache_hit` | The response came from the model's on-disk cache |
| `synalinks.fallback` | Every attempt failed and the `fallback` model answered |

Decision model spans add the model that answered and its raw answers:

| Attribute / Output | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `synalinks.response_model` | The versioned model that answered (e.g. `typesafe/jev-1.13.0` for `jev-latest`), which the cost is based on |
| `answers` (span outputs) | The raw answers, with the probabilities and confidence the output values leave out |

### Exception Events

When a module call fails, the span automatically records an exception event with:
- `exception.type`: The exception class name
- `exception.message`: The exception message

A language or decision model call that fails every retry returns `None` rather
than raising, so the program can carry on. Its span is still marked as failed
(`ERROR` status, `synalinks.success` false, exception event with the last error).
When a `fallback` model answers instead, the failed call's span only records the
failure and `synalinks.fallback`, and the fallback call gets its own child span
with its tokens and cost, so they are counted once.

### Users and Sessions

MLflow can associate traces with a user and a chat session, which is useful for
analyzing multi-turn conversations: you can then filter the traces of one
session in the UI and inspect what happened at each turn. MLflow reads two
reserved metadata keys for that, `mlflow.trace.user` and `mlflow.trace.session`.

Synalinks creates its spans outside of MLflow's fluent context (nested module
calls are linked explicitly), so `mlflow.update_current_trace()` does not see
them. Use `synalinks.trace_context()` instead: every trace started inside the
block carries the given user and session.

```python
import synalinks

synalinks.enable_observability()

# ... build your program ...

with synalinks.trace_context(user_id="user-123", session_id="session-123"):
    result = await program(inputs)
```

The context is stored in a `contextvars.ContextVar`, so it is safe to set per
request in an async server: concurrent requests each see their own value, and
the tasks spawned inside the block (parallel branches, agent tool calls)
inherit it. Nested blocks merge with the enclosing one, the innermost value
winning.

```python
@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: ChatRequest):
    with synalinks.trace_context(user_id=request.user_id, session_id=request.session_id):
        return await program(request.messages)
```

You can also attach free-form trace `metadata` (immutable once the trace is
logged) and `tags` (editable afterwards in the MLflow UI):

```python
with synalinks.trace_context(
    user_id="user-123",
    session_id="session-123",
    metadata={"turn": "3"},
    tags={"env": "production"},
):
    result = await program(inputs)
```

### Viewing Traces

1. Open MLflow UI at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Navigate to your experiment
3. Click on a run to see detailed traces
4. Use the trace view to explore the call hierarchy

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

You can also configure MLflow using environment variables:

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
```

Then in your code:

```python
import synalinks

# Will use MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI from environment
synalinks.enable_observability(experiment_name="my_experiment")
```

### Direct Monitor Hook

For fine-grained control, you can create a Monitor hook directly:

```python
import synalinks

monitor = synalinks.hooks.Monitor(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000", experiment_name="custom_experiment"
)

# Add to a specific module
generator = synalinks.Generator(data_model=Answer, hooks=[monitor])
```

## Training Metrics and Artifacts

The `Monitor` callback logs each `fit()` run to MLflow. When `enable_observability()`
was called it is added to every `fit()` and `evaluate()` automatically; pass one in
`callbacks=[...]` to customize it. A training run holds:

- **Metrics**, one point per epoch: the training metrics, the `val_*` validation
  metrics, the spend of the epoch (`epoch_cost`, `epoch_tokens`, `epoch_calls`, and
  `epoch_cost_inference` / `epoch_cost_reward` / `epoch_cost_optimizer` when non-zero),
  the running spend of the fit (`fit_cost`, `fit_tokens`), the all-time in-process
  spend (`total_cost`, `total_tokens`), `epoch_duration_s`, and `fit_duration_s` at the
  end. With `log_batch_metrics=True`, batch metrics are logged as `train_batch_*` and
  `val_batch_*` with their own step counters.
- **Params**: the fit arguments (epochs, batch and minibatch size, validation split and
  frequency, dataset sizes), the compile configuration (reward, metrics, optimizer and
  its config), the program (name, class, number of modules and trainable variables)
  and every language or embedding model reachable from the program
  (`lm.<name>.model`, api base, sampling settings).
- **Datasets**: the train and validation sets as MLflow dataset inputs of the run, one
  row per sample with JSON `inputs` and `expectations` columns.
- **The program plot**, **the program model** and **its prompts**, described below.

### Basic Usage

```python
import synalinks

# Create the monitor callback
monitor = synalinks.callbacks.Monitor(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000",
    experiment_name="training_experiment",
    run_name="my_training_run",
    log_program_plot=True,  # Save program visualization as artifact
)

# Use during training
program.fit(x=train_inputs, y=train_labels, epochs=10, callbacks=[monitor])
```

### Program Plot Artifact

When `log_program_plot=True` (the default), the Monitor callback automatically saves
a visualization of your program architecture as an MLflow artifact at the start of training.

The plot is saved under `program_plots/` in the artifacts folder and includes:

- Module names and types
- Input/output schemas
- Trainable status of each module

You can view the program plot in the MLflow UI under the "Artifacts" tab of your run.

### Program Model

When `log_program_model=True` (the default), the Monitor callback logs the whole
program (architecture and trained variables, the JSON written by `Program.save()`) as
an MLflow **pyfunc model** wrapped in `synalinks.callbacks.SynalinksProgramModel`.
A new model is logged every time `val_reward` improves (`reward` without validation
data, the end of training when neither is available). Each is an MLflow 3
**LoggedModel** version of type `synalinks_program`, linked to the training run and
carrying the epoch metrics logged at that step, so the Versions view of the experiment
compares them side by side; the best one is tagged `synalinks.best`. Every logged
model is also registered in the **Model Registry** under the program's name, so
`models:/<program name>/<version>` and registry aliases work out of the box.

- The model can be loaded and served anywhere `synalinks` is installed:

```python
import mlflow

model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(f"models:/{model_id}")
model.predict({"question": "What is the capital of France?"})
# [{"answer": "Paris"}]
```

or with `mlflow models serve -m models:/<model_id>`. The model's signature is derived
from the program's input and output JSON schemas (inferred from the first training
sample when the schema cannot be expressed). Custom `DataModel`, `Module` or `Program`
subclasses are resolved by `Program.load()` from their import path, so the code
declaring them only needs to be importable where the model is loaded.

The model id is written into the saved program (`program._mlflow_model_id`, persisted
by `Program.save()` under the `mlflow` key). A later `evaluate()` of that program, even
in another process after `Program.load()`, links its metrics and traces to that model
version and nests its run under the training run.

### Prompt Registry

The prompts of the program's trainable
modules (`Generator`, `ChainOfThought`, ... every module holding an `Instructions`
variable) are registered in the MLflow **Prompt Registry** under the name
`<program>.<module>`. Each registered version is a chat prompt: the system turn is the
module's prompt rendered from its optimized instructions and few-shot examples, the
user turn holds the `{{ inputs }}` template variable, `response_format` is the module's
output JSON schema and `model_config` its language model settings, so the version can
be replayed in the MLflow Playground and evaluated with `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`.

A new version is created at every epoch where the rendered prompt changed. Its commit
message and `val_reward` tag record the validation reward of that epoch (the state the
validation scored is the one registered), along with the epoch, run id, program, module
and optimizer. At the end of training the best-scoring version receives the `best`
alias:

```python
prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt("prompts:/my_program.generator@best")
```

Versions are linked to the training run, to the logged model (`prompts=` of the model,
shown on the model page) and to every later trace of the module (`mlflow.linkedPrompts`).

### Callback Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `experiment_name` | Program name | MLflow experiment name |
| `run_name` | Program name | MLflow run name, suffixed `_train` / `_test` |
| `tracking_uri` | Local `./mlruns` | MLflow tracking server URI |
| `log_batch_metrics` | `False` | Log metrics at batch level |
| `log_epoch_metrics` | `True` | Log metrics at epoch level |
| `log_program_plot` | `True` | Save program visualization as artifact |
| `log_program_model` | `True` | Log the program as a registered MLflow model, a new version per reward improvement |
| `tags` | `{}` | Additional tags for the run |
| `run_id` | `None` | Existing run to resume instead of starting a new one; the step counter continues after the last logged step |
| `resume` | `False` | Look up a run named `run_name` in the experiment and resume it, creating it the first time |
| `log_assessments` | `True` | Log each evaluated sample's reward as a feedback assessment on its trace |

### Example with Full Configuration

```python
import synalinks

monitor = synalinks.callbacks.Monitor(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000",
    experiment_name="gsm8k_optimization",
    run_name="chain_of_thought_v1",
    log_batch_metrics=True,
    log_epoch_metrics=True,
    log_program_plot=True,
    tags={"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "optimizer": "RandomFewShot", "dataset": "gsm8k"},
)

program.fit(x=train_questions, y=train_answers, epochs=5, callbacks=[monitor])
```

## Evaluation Results Over Time

`program.evaluate()` with the `Monitor` callback logs the reward and metrics of that
evaluation to an MLflow run. Runs without a logged model are listed in the experiment's
**Evaluation runs** tab (`/#/experiments/<id>/evaluation-runs`), where the charts view
compares the metrics of every evaluation. The run is tagged `mlflow.runType =
genai_evaluate`, like the runs created by `mlflow.genai.evaluate()`, and the traces of
the evaluated calls are linked to it. Each evaluated sample's reward is also logged as
a `reward` feedback assessment on the sample's trace, with the ground truth as an
`expected_output` expectation, so the run's traces can be sorted and filtered by score
(disable with `log_assessments=False`). The run also logs `eval_cost`, `eval_tokens`,
`eval_duration_s` and the evaluated dataset.

When the evaluated program was trained with a `Monitor` (or loaded from a program saved
after such a training), the evaluation run is nested under the training run
(`mlflow.parentRunId`) and its metrics and traces are linked to the logged model
version, so the Versions view shows evaluation results per model version.

When `synalinks.enable_observability()` was called, a `Monitor` callback created without
`experiment_name` uses that same experiment, so the evaluation runs appear next to the
traces:

```python
import synalinks

synalinks.enable_observability(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000", experiment_name="my_app"
)

# ... build and compile your program ...

monitor = synalinks.callbacks.Monitor(run_name="eval")
await program.evaluate(x=test_x, y=test_y, callbacks=[monitor])
```

Each `evaluate()` call creates one run, so the Evaluation runs charts show one point per
evaluation. To draw the metrics as a curve inside a single run instead, like the epoch
curves of `fit()`, resume the same run on every evaluation with `resume=True`: the
callback looks up the run named `run_name` in the experiment (creating it the first
time), and logs each evaluation at the next step. This works across processes, so a
scheduled evaluation appends one point per execution:

```python
monitor = synalinks.callbacks.Monitor(run_name="nightly_eval", resume=True)
await program.evaluate(x=test_x, y=test_y, callbacks=[monitor])
```

In the MLflow UI, open the run and plot the metric against its step, or against wall
time to see the results over time. Pass `run_id` instead of `resume` to resume a
specific run; `monitor.run_id` holds the id of the run in use.

## Combining Tracing with Training

When using both `enable_observability()` and the `Monitor` callback for training:

1. **During program building** (symbolic calls): Traces go to the experiment specified
   in `enable_observability()`

2. **During training** (`fit()`): Traces are associated with the training run and go to
   the experiment of the `Monitor` callback. When the callback has no
   `experiment_name`, that is the experiment of `enable_observability()`, so traces and
   runs stay together; give the callback its own `experiment_name` to keep them apart.

### Full Example

```python
import synalinks

# Enable tracing for all module calls
synalinks.enable_observability(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000",
    experiment_name="synalinks_traces",  # Traces during setup go here
)

# Create your program (symbolic traces created here)
inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Question)
outputs = await synalinks.Generator(
    data_model=Answer,
    language_model=language_model,
)(inputs)

program = synalinks.Program(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, name="my_program")

# Create Monitor callback for training
monitor = synalinks.callbacks.Monitor(
    tracking_uri="http://localhost:5000",
    experiment_name="training_runs",  # Training metrics + traces go here
    run_name="experiment_v1",
)

# Train - traces during fit() are associated with the training run
program.compile(reward=reward, optimizer=optimizer)
await program.fit(x=train_x, y=train_y, epochs=5, callbacks=[monitor])
```

After training, you'll have:
- **synalinks_traces experiment**: Setup traces (symbolic module calls)
- **training_runs experiment**: Training run with metrics, artifacts, and execution traces

## Best Practices

1. **Enable observability early** in your script, before creating any modules
2. **Use meaningful experiment names** to organize your traces by project or feature
3. **Use persistent storage** (PostgreSQL) for production deployments
4. **Set up retention policies** to manage storage for long-running applications

## Troubleshooting

### No traces being created

If you don't see any traces in MLflow:

1. **Check call order**: Ensure `enable_observability()` is called **before** creating any modules
   ```python
   # Wrong - modules created before enabling observability
   inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Question)
   synalinks.enable_observability()  # Too late!

   # Correct - enable first
   synalinks.enable_observability()
   inputs = synalinks.Input(data_model=Question)  # Now traces will be created
   ```

2. **Verify observability is enabled**: Check with `synalinks.is_observability_enabled()`

3. **Check the correct experiment**: During training, traces go to the training experiment,
   not the observability experiment

### MLflow not receiving traces

1. Verify the MLflow server is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
2. Check the tracking URI is correct
3. Ensure `mlflow` package is installed: `pip install mlflow`

### Artifacts not showing in MLflow UI

If artifacts are uploaded but don't appear in the MLflow UI:

1. **Check server configuration**: Ensure the MLflow server is started with `--serve-artifacts` flag
2. **Verify artifact root**: The server must use `--default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/` for remote clients
3. **Check permissions**: The server needs write access to `--artifacts-destination` path

**Correct server configuration:**
```bash
mlflow server \
    --serve-artifacts \
    --default-artifact-root mlflow-artifacts:/ \
    --artifacts-destination /mlflow/artifacts
```

**Common mistake** - Missing `--serve-artifacts` causes clients to try writing directly to the server's local filesystem, resulting in permission errors like:
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/mlflow'
```

### Missing cost information

Cost tracking requires the language model to return usage information. Ensure your LLM provider supports this feature.

Decision models are billed on input tokens only, at a price known per versioned
model. For a model missing from the built-in price table, pass `cost_per_token`
to the `DecisionModel`.
